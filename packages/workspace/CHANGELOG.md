# @cotal-ai/workspace

## 0.69.0

### Patch Changes

- 93716c3: The loopback check that lets plain http carry a credential now has one definition, `isLoopbackLiteral` in `@cotal-ai/core`. `agent-bearer --exchange-url`, the pinned exchange, enrollment redeem, the managed handoff reader and workspace `isLoopbackHost` all call it, so a fix to the rule can no longer reach only some of them. It parses the address, so every IPv6 spelling of `::1` is loopback and a dotted host that is not an IPv4 literal, such as `127.0.0.09`, is not. `isLoopbackHost` keeps only the legacy IPv4 canonicalization a `nats://` host needs.
- 3a1716d: Every manager stop the CLI makes now runs the stop `cotal down` runs. Ctrl-C on a foreground `cotal up`, the teardown after its broker exits, the leftover-manager stop before `cotal up -f` and the delivery cutover preflight used a second stop that took no stop reservation, skipped the spare-capability check and gave up after 2s, leaving a wedged manager running with its record kept. They now hold the reservation, so a stop while another `cotal down` is stopping the manager is refused and leaves that stop's `--with-agents` policy in place, verify the spare capability before signalling, and send `SIGKILL` to a manager still running 15s after `SIGTERM`. Ctrl-C stops the manager first and, when that stop fails, signals nothing else and leaves the stack running. A pre-pin manager record whose pid now runs a process that is not a manager is removed without a signal on every path, `cotal down` included. The workspace exports `stopReservationPath`, the one spelling of a pidfile's stop reservation.
- 98d2b41: Resolve a spawn's harness through one shared rule. Foreground `cotal spawn`, the detached `--resume` carry and the manager's `start` now all call `resolveAgentType` in `@cotal-ai/workspace` (`--agent`, then the persona's `agent:` pin, then a detached caller's default, then `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT`, then the product default). The foreground path no longer spells the product default as its own literal, so it can no longer pick a different harness than a detached spawn of the same persona. Behavior is unchanged while the product default stays `claude`.

## 0.68.0

### Patch Changes

- a5256fd: Ctrl-C on a foreground `cotal up`, and a broker that exits under it, now stop the delivery daemon with the same stop `cotal down delivery` uses. Before, that teardown took no stop reservation and never escalated past SIGTERM: a concurrent `cotal down delivery` could not see the stop in progress, and a daemon that did not exit on SIGTERM survived the teardown while `up` went on to stop the broker. The teardown now holds the reservation, sends SIGKILL after the 15-second grace, and removes the daemon's credential only once its death is confirmed. If the broker exits while the Ctrl-C teardown is running, `up` waits for that teardown to finish before it exits. `cotal down delivery` now clears a record whose pid belongs to another program without signalling it, as the `up` teardown already did. A local process descriptor can carry `isOwnCommand` for that check; an installed extension's descriptor is cached as data and is refused if it declares one.
- 41a7e66: A provenance line (`→ using`, `→ wrote`, `→ removed`) is always one line. A control character or Unicode line separator in the announced name or path is printed as a `\uXXXX` escape, so a newline in a path such as `HOME` can no longer split one announcement into a second line the command never wrote, and a carriage return can no longer overwrite it on a terminal. The stdout line printed when stderr fails follows the same rule.

## 0.67.0

### Minor Changes

- f389576: `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` carries a Claude session held on the operator's host to a manager on another host, as `docs/design/resume-transfer.md` lays out. The CLI finds the transcript with the connector's new `resumeTranscript` locator and writes it into a JetStream Object Store bucket owned by the target instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, as a chain that an interrupted carry continues. The manager's new operator-only `transcript-receive` command stages it, removes the broker object, and issues a one-time `resumeClaim` that `spawn` consumes; a re-run of the same bytes moves none. The seat forks the transcript in a seat-private Claude home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps --wide` names the source host, session, digest and carry time. The manager cluster document moves to revision 21. Two one-shot credentials carry it on an authenticated mesh: a `transfer-writer` the CLI mints from the space's signing seed for the one transcript it hashed, or on a user-auth mesh exchanges from the operator's login as the new `transfer-writer` view (scope `admin`), and a `transfer-reader` the target manager mints for its own bucket on each receive or sweep, or that the host issues a remote manager through the new manager-service `transferReader` operation. A carried seat records the digest of the transcript Claude forked, and the manager stops a seat whose record does not match the carried bytes, including one whose launch was uncertain and that joined later. Space deletion lists the transfer buckets and deletes them: `deleteSpace` given the space's trust material mints its own `teardown` naming them, and it now throws naming every stream it could not delete instead of reporting success. The console space picker deletes a space this host registered as a static-auth mesh that way. The `transfer-writer` view, and the broker connection minted from it, lives at most five minutes, the static credential's lifetime.

### Patch Changes

- 55061ff: `cotal ext add` now reports an extension that needs an export its linked `@cotal-ai/*` peer does not have the way a later load of it does: it names which install is behind and what to rebuild or upgrade. It used to print only the raw missing-export import error. First-run and upgrade seeding add every built-in connector through this path.
- bb0b14e: A manager's per-root identity no longer travels with a mesh's trust folder. The instance identity and the goal-writer and session-ledger identities now live in the root's own space segment, `.cotal/space.<space-hex>/manager-instance.json` and `manager-siblings.json`, instead of `.cotal/auth`. Copying `.cotal/auth` to another root, as the docs describe for a mesh you did not start, used to copy them too, so `cotal supervise` there was refused as the original manager while it ran, and came up as that same instance once it stopped. A root that still holds the records in `.cotal/auth` has them moved on first use and keeps its instance across the upgrade; both locations holding a record is refused. When the manager lease refusal comes from a manager in a different root, it now says "another workspace root" instead of "this workspace root", and it reports the holder of the conflicting instance's own lease.
- 3069425: A manager on an authenticated mesh now keeps its goal-writer and session-ledger identities across restarts, as it already kept its serve identity. They were minted fresh on every start, so each restart added two holders to the manager's credential family, which never drops a row, and every later re-registration verify-evicted all of them again before the manager answered on its endpoint rails. The two identities are minted on the first start into a new secret file beside the instance identity (`.cotal/space.<space-hex>/manager-siblings.json`), published by exclusive create so concurrent first starts adopt one pair, and read back on every later start. A malformed file fails the start rather than being replaced. A family that already grew keeps its rows and is still swept on each restart, but restarts no longer add to it. `@cotal-ai/workspace` exports the `claimManagerSiblingIdentities` helper that does this.
- ae5b3cd: A manager or delivery start on an upgraded root no longer aborts with `ENOENT` when the pre-upgrade `manager.pid`, `manager.delivery-aware` or `delivery.pid` record it is reclaiming is removed after it was listed and before it was read, which happens when the pre-upgrade daemon exits or a concurrent start reclaims the same record. `reclaimDeadPreUpgradeRecord` still finds the record by its byte-exact name, then reads it once through `readPidfile` and moves on to the next spelling when it is gone. Every other read error still propagates, and the empty, unattributable, live and unknown-liveness rules are unchanged.

## 0.66.1

### Patch Changes

- 568f718: `cotal down` no longer fails with `ENOENT` when a component removes its own process record while the command runs. The record readers in `down`, the manager, delivery and auth-service helpers, and `cotal service status` checked that a pidfile existed and then read it, so a record removed between the two calls threw: `cotal down manager` printed `✗ ENOENT` and `✗ not cleanly stopped` and exited 1, and `cotal down nats` aborted before stopping the broker. Each reader now reads the record once through the new `readPidfile` helper in `@cotal-ai/workspace`. A record that is gone takes the no-record path, and any other read error still throws.

## 0.63.0

### Patch Changes

- 9d5cc09: First-run `cotal setup` now shares your own Claude Code MCP servers with the sessions Cotal spawns. It copies the user-scope servers from your Claude Code config into the cotal config's `connectors.claude.mcpServers` and names them in its output, so a spawned session has the tools you know plus the cotal tools. Before this, a spawned session loaded only the cotal server and setup never said why. With none to copy it writes an empty list, and a cotal config that already declares that list keeps it. A server with an `env` or `headers` value that is anything but `${VAR}` references is left out and named, because the cotal config keeps secrets only as `${VAR}` references. So is an entry no session can start, such as one with a missing or empty `command` or `url`, or one whose `command` is not a string. For a lighter seat, remove entries from the cotal config or spawn with `--share-tools none`. Connector setup providers gain an optional `mcpServers` action whose `seed` input the CLI binds to workspace's new `seedConnectorServers`, which writes under a lock so two setups run at once record one list. Core exports `readCotalConfigFile` and the `ConnectorShareSetupInput` type, and connector-core exports the `ENV_REFERENCE` pattern it already used.

## 0.62.0

### Minor Changes

- b36bebf: `cotal spawn --detach` run from a managed seat's own shell on a static or open mesh now launches as that seat, so the manager records the seat as the spawner and the seat can stop the child with `cotal_despawn`, as it can a `cotal_spawn` child. Before, the CLI minted a one-shot operator instrument that no session could present again, and the seat's despawn was refused. `--on <instance>` keeps its pin on that path: on a static mesh the CLI mints a one-shot `manager-caller` view for the seat, pinned to that instance and carrying the spawn subject only when the seat's own credential holds it. On an open mesh the seat's call keeps the TLS requirement the mesh records, and `--server` with an unregistered `--space` keeps the operator path. Without `--space` the seat's target is picked as the operator path picks it, skipping a recorded mesh that is not running. The child is now stopped when the seat exits, and on a static mesh a seat without `capabilities: [spawn]` is refused. The seat-scoped control target that `cotal run` already used on a static mesh moves to `@cotal-ai/workspace` as `resolveSeatControlTarget`; `cotal run` keeps using it on a static mesh only. On a static mesh the seat's credential also proves its space, so a seat launched without `COTAL_SPACE` still acts as itself, as `cotal run answer` did before; an open mesh acts as the seat only when `COTAL_SPACE` names its space. See docs/UPGRADING.md.

### Patch Changes

- 877909b: A provenance line (`→ using`, `→ wrote`, `→ removed`) no longer fails or crashes a command when stderr is broken. When the stderr write throws or fails with an error such as EPIPE or ENOSPC, at once or after waiting in a full pipe whose reader goes away, the line is printed on stdout with the error and the command finishes its work. This holds for a write that throws a value that is not an Error, such as `null` or an object with no string form. It also holds when the program has already ended stderr, even if it exits in the same tick. When stdout fails too, the command still finishes its work and exits 1 instead of 0, so a line no channel could carry is never lost silently. The same holds for a line still waiting in a full stderr pipe when the command exits, as when the CLI exits on a closed stdout. A program that ends itself on a stdout error, as the CLI does, still stops at that error instead of finishing its work. Node does not say which stderr bytes are still waiting, so a line that had to wait and got through just before the exit counts the same while later stderr output still waits. A connector seed run with a broken stderr used to commit every payload and then exit 1 with nothing said, or stop after the first payload and require `cotal ext seed --repair`. A stderr that is closed or redirected away at launch still discards the line.
- 5ef9a67: Bare `cotal down` stops a stack whose manager runs the built-in `pty` runtime and has never started an agent. Since the `pty` runtime stopped using a seat custodian, its manager published no spare capability at all, so bare `cotal down` refused every default stack, left the broker running and kept the space registered, and the next `cotal up` of that space was refused as already in use. Ctrl-C on a foreground `cotal up` now holds the manager's stop reservation from its capability check until the manager exits, as `cotal down` does, so a concurrent `cotal down` cannot stop that manager or arm a reap while the Ctrl-C stop is in flight.
- 565036c: Let bare `cotal down` and Ctrl-C on a foreground `cotal up` stop a stack whose manager runs the built-in in-process `pty` runtime. That manager published no spare capability, so bare `cotal down` refused to signal it even with no agents running, left the broker up, and kept the registry entry; a default `Manager.stop()` threw on any pty seat. A default stop now stops and deprovisions the pty seats that live inside the manager process, since they cannot outlive it, and still releases every seat that can. The manager always publishes its spare capability, which now records whether its stop also stops in-process seats, and `down` reports those seats as stopped instead of left running. An older CLI refuses the new record rather than misreport those seats. A stopping manager refuses new spawns and waits for the ones it already accepted, so no seat launches after a stop that reported success, and `down` no longer promises that agents will be spared when it cannot list them. Repeated `Manager.stop()` calls share one stop, so a second call no longer reports success while the first still waits for a seat to exit.

### Minor Changes

- 70bcfe3: Breaking: `cotal actor grant` no longer turns an omitted ACL flag into the wide default, so a bare grant that used to succeed now needs `--full`. A grant must name `--scope`, `--allow-subscribe` and `--allow-publish`, or pass `--full` to take `spawn,role:default`, `>` and `>` for the ones left off. Otherwise it refuses, writes nothing, and prints both forms. Dropping one flag from a narrow event-plane reader grant used to mint a row that read or posted to every channel, or could spawn, with a success line as the only sign. The hints printed by `cotal login`, `cotal status`, `actor list` and the not-granted refusal now include `--full`.

### Patch Changes

- 1cf7f72: `ConnectRefusal` now carries a `kind`: `transient` when the broker could not be reached or answered too slowly, or no mesh is recorded yet, and `permanent` for every other refusal. A `cotal attach` that is reconnecting after its link died now exits non-zero with the refusal's own sentence when the refusal is permanent, such as a static-auth mesh whose seed has gone missing. It used to retry that forever behind `[cotal: connection lost, reconnecting]` with no explanation.
- 5bec8b2: `cotal attach` now opens a seat's session on a user-auth mesh. The CLI presents its bearer identity together with the session grant to the auth service's exchange, which issues a `session-caller` view bearer only after it confirms, against the redeemed `session.<id>` row and the serving manager gate, that this owner and actor hold that session. The callout re-checks the same row and mints the same `session-caller` rails with the grant's expiry that the static path mints. No local seed is read or written.
- cfc3b95: `cotal status` now has one Machine row per installed connector instead of fixed `Claude` and `OpenCode` rows. Each row reports whether the executables that connector declares in `requires` are on PATH, so a machine running Codex, jcode, pi or Hermes sees its harness. The `Claude plugin` and `Claude skills` rows now come from the Claude Code connector: a setup provider may declare a read-only `status`, and `cotal status` and the setup card print the rows it returns. A machine without the Claude connector no longer shows them. The extensions manifest caches each connector's setup ref, so status imports only connectors that declare a provider, and the seed reconcile refreshes a seeded entry whose cache predates it instead of checking the Claude connector by name. The debug handoff that `cotal setup` offers when a step fails now comes from connectors: a setup provider may declare an `assist`, and the menu offers one `Debug it with <harness>` option for each present connector that declares one. The Claude Code connector declares the existing Claude handoff. When no connector can host a handoff, the menu says so instead of silently omitting the option.
- b669a73: `cotal deliver` takes `--root <dir>` to name the workspace root it serves instead of inheriting it from the working directory. Without the flag, a workstation daemon started from a directory with no `.cotal/` above it now refuses at start and names the directory it searched from. It used to read its credential and registry from that directory, dial the broker, and only then refuse on a missing `$SYS` observer. `@cotal-ai/workspace` adds `requireCotalRoot`, the same walk as `findCotalRoot` without the fallback to the start directory.
- 608f5f4: Re-attach doc comments that had drifted away from the declarations they document. A `/** */` block followed directly by another one documented nothing, so editor hovers and the published type declarations showed no doc for the intended declaration (for example `Manager`, the `plane3` field and `AclResolver`). Each such block now sits above its declaration, is merged into the block it duplicated, or is removed when its declaration no longer exists. A new `pnpm check:doc-comments` check, run as part of `check:docsbundle`, refuses a doc block followed directly by another in shipped source.
- 06f48f4: CLI output is plain text when stdout is not a terminal or `NO_COLOR` is set to a non-empty value. The shared color helpers used to wrap every string in ANSI escapes, so `cotal --help`, `cotal status`, `cotal meshes` and the red error lines on stderr carried escapes into pipes and log files. The manager's and the delivery daemon's own always-on copies are gone; `cotal supervise` and `cotal feedback-intake` now print through the same helpers. The guided `cotal setup` and `cotal meshes add` prompts follow the same rule, so `FORCE_COLOR` now reaches them too. `FORCE_COLOR` turns color back on even when output is piped, unless it is `0` or `false`, and it takes precedence over `NO_COLOR`, the order Node uses.
- 438e9ed: Close the pid record publish window. A launcher that died between removing the old identity pin and publishing the new pidfile left the old pid with no pin, which teardown signalled with only a legacy warning, even when the removed pin had been refusing a reused pid. The publish now renames a bridge pin holding the old and the new record's lines before the pidfile commit, and teardown checks the pidfile's pid against its own line, so every crash point leaves the old or the new complete record. Publishes of one pidfile are serialized by a lock, so a launcher and the daemon it starts can no longer overwrite each other's bridge or settled pin. A publish that cannot read a start token for the new process gives it a `-` pin line, so a crash after the commit reads the legacy record it was publishing, never the new pid beside the old pin. Replacing a legacy record carries its line as `-`, so an interrupted replace leaves it legacy, never torn. Teardown and a daemon's exit cleanup remove a record under the same lock, and only while the pidfile still names the pid they stopped, so a stop that races a publish can no longer leave the new pidfile with no pin. `removeIdentityPin` is deprecated in favor of `removePidPair` and stays exported unchanged for one minor line.
- 6145abc: Resume a preserved user-auth mesh as the logged-in operator. `cotal up` after `down --preserve-state` used a static instrument whose caller has no ledger row, so the manager refused `resume-preserved` for want of `admin` and the maintenance journal degraded. The resume now uses the operator's manager view, the same caller the preserve cut used.

### Minor Changes

- 95ae645: The auth retirement rail is a conforming registered endpoint with a describable contract. The requester calls it through the generic client in the exact target mode. A legacy body is refused as unsupported-version.

### Patch Changes

- fba1537: A repair `up` after a broker died reopens the store the mesh record names and refuses a different `--store-dir`. A foreground `up` whose broker exits unexpectedly keeps the mesh record, names the exit and the repair, and exits non-zero.
- 576f622: A process's pidfile and its identity pin now publish as one rename-based transition, so a crash between the two writes never leaves a torn pair (old pid beside a new pin, or a new pid beside an old one). A crash still leaves one of the legacy shapes teardown already handles.
- ee6de5d: Expose provider-neutral hosted context lifecycle types for explicit service inputs and readiness, without changing existing CLI behavior.
- e9ef5b3: Add `retireManagerInstanceIdentity(root, space, expected)`, which deletes a space's persisted manager instance identity only when the stored record is the complete expected identity. A symlinked, malformed or different record is refused and kept, and a missing record returns `absent` so an interrupted retirement can be retried.

- ef8889d: The raw off-registry preflight (`--creds`, or `--server` with an unregistered `--space`) re-probes at the same 8s confirm budget the registry preflight uses before refusing, so a live broker on a slow link connects instead of being reported as not running, and the timeout sentence names a budget that was spent (#709).

## 0.55.0

### Patch Changes

- a83dd80: Preflight reports a probe that ran out of its budget as a slow link instead of a trust failure: `probeConnect` now returns a distinct `timeout` reason, `preflightTarget` routes it to a new `slow-link` verdict without consulting the INFO greeting, and the rendered sentence names the connect budget and says the registry entry was kept, never a CA. A real certificate failure against a TLS-required mesh still renders the `tls-trust` guidance.
- 4f48629: A raw `--creds` control call (`cotal ps`/`stop`/`attach` with a credential file) is refused for the reason that actually applies: the invocation carries no endpoint-caller triple and that route cannot mint one. The refusal names the missing triple (owner, actor, lifecycle uid), says minting the file again changes nothing, and points at the routes that mint the one-shot instrument (the mesh's project folder, or `--space` against the registry entry). It no longer claims the file predates the v0.4 control surface, which was inferred from the missing triple alone and never read from the credential.

### Minor Changes

- 34beea1: Route user-auth manager calls through a short-lived, instance-bound control credential. Discovery and invocation address the same authorized manager while the agent's standing connection, credentials and conversation remain unchanged. Managed launches retain their manager selection across launch and resume. Static and open mesh routing is unchanged. Confirm the standing goal-progress subscription at the broker before submitting on the separate control connection, so fast terminal events cannot outrun the subscription. Recover accepted goal results through the manager's caller-scoped `goal-result` command after connection replacement, without repeating the mutation or granting clients raw JetStream reads. Followed calls now require a compatible manager before submission; update the issuer, participant manager and client together. Stopping a caller cancels its observation without cancelling the accepted goal. Retain Linux custody records across clean child exit so retirement can prove process identity and finish cleanup even after the custodian removes its file; socket loss alone never frees the alias.

- d1f9703: Supervise of a registered remote user-auth space no longer composes or validates local trust under remote authority. A root hosting an unrelated static space's trust records beside the participant sign-in used to fail with a corrupt-bundle refusal; the manager now consults the store only for the supervised space's own records (account record, or a legacy bundle naming the space), refusing that combination of authorities while other tenants' records are never used. An unreadable record on a key that is read refuses loud with the store's own parse message.

### Patch Changes

- cf5a5cb: The renewal record is per-space: `renewalRecordPath(root, space)` now writes and reads `.cotal/renewal.<spaceKey>.json`, keyed by the same injective hex the pidfiles use, and every writer and reader threads the space — the manager's renewal pass, `doctor auth --fix`'s write, `doctor auth`'s verdict reads, and `status --components`' delivery row. Before, one root-scoped `.cotal/renewal.json` served every space at a root, so with two spaces co-resident the last pass won: a refused adoption in one space was reported as accepted once the other's manager ran a clean pass, and the mirror case reddened a healthy space's doctor. A root-only `renewal.json` left by a pre-per-space build names no space and is never read as any space's verdict; `doctor auth` names it as a leftover with its cleanup, and `cotal clean all` removes it beside the per-space record. Fixes #1850.
- ab0808c: `cotal up --max-file-store <bytes>` sets the broker's JetStream file storage cap. Before, the rendered broker config carried only `store_dir`, so nats-server always sized its store at start as three quarters of the free disk and an operator on a shared disk had no supported way to bound it. `serverConfig` and `openServerConfig` take an optional `maxFileStore` byte count and render `max_file_store` inside the `jetstream{}` block; left unset, the rendered config is byte-identical to before, and a zero, negative or non-integer value throws naming the option. The cap is recorded on the mesh entry, carried through `down --preserve-state` into the resume, and rendered again by the bare `cotal up` that resumes it. A resume or a refresh of a running mesh that asks for a different cap is refused, because nats-server fixes the cap at start and refuses a reload that changes it. The flag is refused with `-f`. Fixes #1888.
- 6b375c8: `cotal update` reports every running manager's continuity, and its refusal carries the remedy

  With several meshes running and the shell outside every project root, the continuity check printed
  the mesh resolver's bare text and exited before writing anything. It now renders that refusal through
  the workspace renderer, the way every other command does, so it carries the `--space` / `cotal use`
  recovery sentence. And because the install replaces the single `cotal-ai` that every running manager
  shares, an unselected run now reports each running manager in turn instead of refusing, with any
  `legacy` verdict making the whole run not a hot update. `--space`, `--server` and `--creds` still
  select exactly one manager, and nothing is written until every selected manager has been observed.

### Minor Changes

- 64d723e: Enable the AG-UI event plane by default for connectors that publish one. Operators and peer spawns
  can opt out explicitly, while connectors without an event plane refuse unless that opt-out is set.
- ec8649b: Preserve the closed required-events registration policy and enforce it across discovery, launch,
  grant coverage, direct connector sessions, and trusted upgrades of existing manual registrations.

### Patch Changes

- 314a12c: Refuse a malformed mesh registry record by name instead of crashing the command that reads it. A
  parseable record missing `server`, `mode`, `root`, or `ts` (or carrying a `mode`/`origin` this build
  does not know) reached the registry listing and crashed `cotal meshes` with a bare TypeError while
  `cotal status` rendered `undefined` columns; an unparseable record was silently skipped, hiding it
  from `cotal meshes rm` too. `loadMeshes` now validates every record and fails loud with the file
  path and the reason, so the operator learns which file is wrong. Every command that loads the
  registry shares the refusal.
- 92a8938: Run a manual registration's policy refresh where the policy is consumed. The refresh reached the
  pinned exchange from the command dispatcher, ahead of every command's own refusals, so `cotal status`
  on a pre-policy manual entry failed on a transport error and `cotal supervise` reported that error
  instead of its `--server` mismatch or missing-login sentence. Spawn, join and supervise now refresh
  after their local refusals; read-only commands never refresh. The bundle validator, the pinned fetch
  and the dial classifier move to `@cotal-ai/workspace` so the manager can share them.
- 949d4d1: Admit seat checkpoints and take custody on the resume path, before anything starts.

  An ordinary `up` from a preserved cut now runs the three admission gates over that cut's seat checkpoints, then claims the seat's next writer generation, all before the resume attempt is journalled and long before a manager launches. A refusal at that point costs nothing; the same refusal after a launch would be a second writer.

  Integrity checks presence, regular non-symlink, byte size and sha256, and re-stats after the read. Identity checks the space, that the recorded `lifecycleUid` is not live, and the profile revision against this host's current digest of the seat's launch config, with no override at all: a differing revision is refused naming both digests and the remedy, because the checkpoint carries the recorded digest and not the config bytes, and the manager re-digests the same file at relaunch and refuses drift on its own. Recency compares `capturedAt` to this host's clock against the horizon the record carries, refusing outside it with all three values named. `--accept-stale-checkpoint` admits a stale checkpoint and records the exercised consent in the resume journal with the seat, the capture instant, the admitted age and the horizon.

  Admission is all or nothing. Coverage is settled first from the cut's own directory listing, then all three gates run over every checkpoint, and only when the whole set has passed does any generation get claimed. A refusal anywhere leaves every generation unclaimed, including a lost exclusive create inside the claim phase itself: the claims made by that attempt are removed before the refusal is raised, by the exact paths it wrote and nothing else, so a generation another destination holds is never touched. The resume can then be retried over a repaired checkpoint set. Custody is claimed by exclusive create on the recorded generation plus one, and a lost create refuses rather than adopting the winner.

  Admission is reconciled against the inventory the resume is about to hand the manager. A retained seat with no admitted checkpoint refuses the resume by name, before any gate runs and before any generation is claimed: an absent checkpoint directory and an absent record look identical to a reader of the directory alone, and a seat that starts without passing the gates has claimed no writer generation.

  Two limits are stated in `docs/cli.md` rather than implied. The writer generation is claimed inside one workspace root, so it fences two resumes on one host and not two independent destinations. And no shipped command consumes the captured bytes: the bundle, diffs and untracked archive are written, digested and admitted, but restoring them is manual today, so an ordinary resume still requires the preserved source store.

  Checkpoints are addressed by the preservation attempt that wrote them, `.cotal/maintenance/v<N>/checkpoints/<attemptId>/<seat>/`, through one shared path helper so the cut and the resume cannot disagree about where they are. A shared per-seat directory made the second cut in a root impossible: the writer refuses a destination that already exists, and deleting the previous one would destroy an artifact a rollback still needs.

- 949d4d1: Add seat checkpoints: the content-addressed record describing one preserved seat well enough to start it on another host, its writer and reader, the three admission gates a destination runs before it launches, and the per-seat writer generation that keeps one writer at a time.

  The record carries the manager's resume entry unchanged as its first field, the generation it was cut at, `capturedAt`, the recency horizon, the continuity class and the applied profile revision. Every captured file is recorded by path, byte size and sha256, and the record is written last, after those digests are computed over the bytes that landed. The writer refuses a destination that already exists and hardens it to 0700 before anything lands.

  Admission is three gates in order, each refusing with what it saw. Integrity: present, regular, non-symlink, size and sha256, with a re-stat after the read so a file that moved is a refusal. Identity: the recorded lifecycle uid is not live, the space matches, and the profile revision matches or is deliberately resumed under; this gate has no override. Recency: `capturedAt` against the destination clock and the horizon in the record, refused by default with all three values in the message, overridable by explicit operator consent that the caller records.

  The writer generation is persisted beside the manager instance identity and claimed by exclusive create on the successor value before anything launches. It uses `createManagerInstanceIdentity`'s publication primitive and deliberately not its resolution: a lost create there adopts the winner, because two managers sharing one logical instanceId is intended; here a lost create means two hosts claiming one seat, so it refuses.

- f50e20d: Restore an admitted seat checkpoint on the destination, before the preserved resume starts.

  A destination used to admit a checkpoint and then launch the seat against whatever happened to be at `launch.cwd`. The captured bundle, the two diffs and the untracked archive were written, digested and admitted, and nothing consumed them. `cotal up` now puts those bytes back, as a step of the preserved-resume path that runs after every gate has passed over every checkpoint and before a single writer generation is claimed, so a refusal costs nothing for the same reason a gate failure does.

  Each seat stages beside its own `cwd`. Every recorded digest is verified again over the files as they are now; the bundle is cloned into `<cwd>.incoming`, refused when that path already exists; the recorded base commit is verified in the clone and checked out detached; the index diff is applied with `--index` and the worktree diff without it, both `--binary --allow-empty`; the untracked archive is extracted. Every seat stages before any seat is promoted, and promotion moves an existing `cwd` aside to `<cwd>.superseded.<timestamp>` before renaming the staging directory into place. Those two renames are the only steps that touch the path the seat will use, so a failure anywhere leaves every seat's live `cwd` as it was, promotes nothing and claims no generation. `git` and `tar` run as child processes with argument arrays, never a shell string.

  The superseded name is claimed before anything moves, by exclusive directory create, with a numeric suffix when the name is taken. The timestamp has one-second resolution, so two promotions of the same seat within one second would otherwise compute the same path, and the second rename would either replace the tree the first one saved or fail on it. A name this step could not create is a name it does not use.

  A leftover `<cwd>.incoming` refuses by name and is never removed automatically: a staging directory from a failed run is the only record of what failed, so an operator inspects it and removes it by hand. A pre-existing `cwd` is renamed rather than deleted, so a wrong checkpoint costs a rename instead of a tree.

  The promoted tree is verified once more. A checkpoint now records the seat's `git status --porcelain` as the cut read it, under the same selection rule the untracked set was produced under, and the restore re-reads it in the promoted tree and refuses a difference. Both applies can return 0 and still leave an index the source did not have, and this is the only check that sees it.

  The session files travel the same way. The manager's resume entry carries the connector's `sessionStatePath` when the seat has one, `cotal down --preserve-state` takes `--session-store <path>` (repeatable, applied to every continuation-capable retained seat, refused when the path does not exist or is not a directory), and each captured session file records where it lands as an anchor plus a relative path rather than the source host's absolute spelling. The restore places them before the seat launches, so a connector that declares exact continuation is sealed and resumed as `exact` rather than capped. A pointer whose recorded `sessionId` is not the one the retained inventory reopens is refused before anything is cloned, and a session file already present at its destination is judged by content: equal bytes are already restored, different bytes are refused with both digests rather than clobbered.

  `up --restore <dir>` reaches the same admission and the same restore, after the store is restored and validated and before commit intent is journaled. It previously handed a retained inventory to the manager with no gate run, no generation claimed and no restore.

  The incarnation check runs before the restore does. The recorded `lifecycleUid` is reconciled against the inventory the resume is about to hand the manager as a gate over the staged set, so a checkpoint describing a different incarnation refuses with both uids while every live working tree is still in place and no generation has been claimed. That comparison previously ran after admission returned, which is after a tree had been moved aside, another promoted over it and a generation claimed under the checkpoint's uid.

  A restore never moves or replaces the destination's own control directory. A seat whose `cwd` holds a `.cotal/`, the layout an operator gets from running `up` and `spawn` in one directory, is refused before staging: a checkpoint excludes the control directory by design, so promoting a tree that cannot contain it would carry the destination's live trust material and maintenance state away under the superseded tree, and the restore would report success.

  A continuity class of `exact` or `fork` now requires the pointer and at least one store file. A pointer alone names a session whose transcript the artifact does not hold, and it is capped like a cut carrying neither.

- a0c8a59: Discover a signed-in account's advertised spaces lazily, cache validated snapshots, and add `cotal sync` for explicit refreshes.
- 26d864b: `cotal update` and `cotal update --self` complete on a machine with no recorded mesh instead of refusing with "no mesh running": there is no running manager to observe there, so the continuity read is skipped. The same holds when every recorded mesh is down and none is selected. A recorded mesh that is down still refuses when the command selects it, with `--space` or from inside its project, and so does a named space that is not running. A connect refusal that came from mesh-target resolution now carries that target error as its `cause`.

### Minor Changes

- ba91ad5: Attach on an open-mode mesh, which never has a local seed

  `cotal attach` refused every seat on a mesh started with `cotal up --open`, saying it needed this
  space's local seed to redeem the session grant. An open-mode mesh has no seed by design, so the
  refusal fired on exactly the configuration attach exists to serve, and its remedy pointed at
  re-registering a root the mesh had already resolved correctly.

  How a session grant is redeemed is now the recorded mesh contract, carried as a value rather than
  inferred from whether a credential happens to be present. An open mesh redeems over the same bare
  connection the control round trip already used, and nothing is minted or synthesised for it. A
  static-auth mesh still mints a session-scoped credential from the seed at the root the mesh
  resolved to, and a static-auth mesh whose seed is missing still refuses, now naming
  restore-at-checkout rather than a re-registration that would change nothing. A user-auth mesh still
  refuses loud: two-step user-mode redemption is not wired.

- 44cdcc2: Make the delivery daemon own its liveness record

  `delivery.<space>.pid` was written only by the CLI launcher, so a daemon started by any other route,
  a container entrypoint, systemd, or an operator running `cotal deliver --space <space>`, left
  whatever was on disk untouched and every reader believed it. On a reporting mesh the record named a
  pid that had been dead for four days while the daemon ran under a different one.

  That is not only an under-report. `cotal down` decides what to stop from the same record, and
  `mayBeRunning` is the guard that must fail closed so `cotal down nats` cannot take the broker away
  from a live dependant. A record naming a dead pid satisfies that guard: it supplies the
  proof-of-death the guard asks for, so a live delivery daemon reads as clear and the broker goes out
  from under it.

  The daemon now writes its own record and removes it, with the identity pin, when it exits. The write
  happens once the single-flight shard lease is held, and not before: a daemon that loses that lease
  refuses to bind and exits, so writing on entry would let a loser overwrite the live holder's record
  on its way out. It is written before the Plane-3 bind so an operator can still stop a daemon whose
  bind hangs; readiness is a separate fact the lease's own flag already carries.

  Readers no longer believe a pid merely because it is alive. The delivery record's liveness gains the
  `foreign` state the manager's already had, for the same reason: a record that outlived its daemon is
  eventually re-pointed at an unrelated process by pid reuse, and `kill(pid, 0)` alone reports that
  stranger as a healthy daemon forever. A live pid is trusted only once its command line has been read
  and names the daemon, and `cotal down` never signals a live process that is provably not one.
  Attribution only downgrades on proof, so a platform with no argv source, an unreadable process, or
  one that exits during the read all behave exactly as before.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- b0aeca4: Make bare `cotal down` and `Manager.stop()` spare managed agents by default. Use
  `cotal down --with-agents` or `Manager.stop({ withAgents: true })` for deliberate destructive
  teardown. Linux PTY seats release manager-local proxy custody while their detached custodians and
  child processes continue running, and the CLI binds destructive intent to the exact live stop
  attempt so an interrupted command cannot poison a later bare shutdown. Managers launched before
  process identity pins existed remain stoppable after the documented reduced-guarantee warning:
  bare down cannot prove which SIGTERM handler that running binary carries, so it never reports the
  pre-signal seat inventory as confirmed spared. A genuinely older destructive handler may still reap
  those agents. `--with-agents` uses a one-shot handoff bound to the manager pid and the live
  stop-reservation inode, then signals unconditionally.
- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.
- e3f2d21: Keep a dead `cotal up` mesh record as offline, with its root in the error

  A liveness miss used to delete every registry record that was not `origin: "manual"`, including
  `origin: "up"` and pre-origin records. `cotal meshes` was the command the error pointed at, and it
  was the command that destroyed the restart authority. The record was already written at provision
  time; this change stops withholding survival from it.

  `pruneMesh` is now reason-gated. `gone` (the liveness sweep, and preflight `unreachable`) keeps
  every origin as `offline`. `mismatch` (credentials rejected, open-now-auth, stale-auth-root) still
  drops an `up` record and still never drops a `manual` one. `cotal down` / `cotal clean all` still
  drop `up` records for the root they tear down.

  The unreachable copy for a kept `up` record still starts `no mesh running at <server>` and then
  names the recorded root, telling the operator to run `cotal up` there, so a bare `cotal up` in
  the wrong cwd cannot start a different mesh.

  A liveness sweep still returns `{ pruned, offline }`. Resolution now uses `offline`: a record
  known dead is not a live candidate for a bare command (`no mesh running` / `multiple meshes
running` name only meshes that answered). `--space` still resolves a dead record so preflight
  can name its root. All-offline is still `no-meshes`; the named-space path is what reports
  "recorded but not running".

- b00f3c1: Refuse a two-root daemon-credential composition at construction. The manager challenges the delivery daemon's reload-store identity before the first remint, and the refusal names both stores. Fingerprint-only reloadCreds stays once both sides read one SecretStore. A store declares its authority identity, or an injected adapter names its coordinate in COTAL_SECRET_STORE on both processes.

### Patch Changes

- 9ff5c22: Make the first manager identity on a fresh root an exclusive create. Of N concurrent starts, exactly one process mints the instance file and the others adopt that identity or refuse with a named error, so they cannot take two leases.
- 062881a: Wire `--max-sessions` from the CLI into the manager's live-session ceiling.

  `ManagerOptions.maxSessions` was documented as deployment-configurable, but nothing in the CLI
  could set it, so every live manager sat at 64. `cotal supervise --max-sessions` and
  `cotal up --max-sessions` now parse a positive integer, pass it into the manager, and record it on
  the mesh so a same-root repair, resume, or `spawn -f` that restarts the manager does not silently
  drop a raised ceiling. A refresh of an already-running manager refuses a different `--max-sessions`
  rather than recording an unapplied setting. A capacity refusal names `--max-sessions`. Default
  remains 64. Size for agents × panes: the browser console opens one session per pane.

- 13f29e1: Pin Windows teardowns to process creation time. A launch writes a sibling identity file from the UTC FILETIME of `Get-Process StartTime`, and a stop refuses when that pin no longer matches. Records with no sibling pin stay on the upgrade-only legacy path.

- 18a0024: The manager hosts workflow runs. `run-start`, `run-resume`, `run-answer`, `run-status` and
  `run-ps` are served on the manager's endpoint rails; a run is validated before anything is
  recorded, driven in the manager's process under a per-run `run-driver` credential, and taken back
  from its journal after a manager restart. `cotal run` is a client of that surface by default,
  with `--local` keeping the in-process drive, now under the run's own `run-driver` and
  `run-operator` credentials rather than `admin`; an answer's writes are pinned to the one pause it
  answers. A user-auth mesh refuses the family by name until a run can carry its user's owner. A new `run` capability mints the family into an
  agent's credential and injects the `cotal_run` tool, so an agent can write a cotal-lang program
  and start it from a session. `run-answer` records the answerer from the caller's credential and
  takes no `by`; `cotal run answer` drops `--by` on the hosted path. `spawn({ supervise })` is a restart policy the manager enforces in
  place: `{ restarts, window? }` (default `10m`) until the budget is spent, then the seat is
  retired and the next `turn` is L4002. A policy this host cannot honour is refused at accept.

A live pre-pin record warns and proceeds so the first teardown after an upgrade still works; relaunching writes the pin and enables full match and mismatch protection.

### Minor Changes

- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.
- 9021896: Make the runtime pid/log namespace per-space. The manager and delivery daemon now record themselves
  as `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.pid`, `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.log`,
  `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.delivery-aware`, `.cotal/delivery.<spaceKey>.pid` and
  `.cotal/delivery.<spaceKey>.log`, through the same `{space}` expansion `auth-service.<spaceKey>.pid`
  already used. The five names were root-scoped constants, so one workspace root hosted one manager and
  one delivery daemon by filename: a second space booting in the same root overwrote the first space's
  record, and every reader of that file then answered about the wrong process. `status`, `down`, `up`,
  `clean` and `spawn -f` take the space they are answering about.

  Existing single-space meshes keep working across the upgrade. Reads admit a pre-segmentation
  root-scoped record while it is the only spelling present, byte-exact, so a `cotal down` still finds
  and stops a daemon started by the previous build instead of orphaning it. Writes are always the
  canonical space-keyed name, and each start reclaims a provably dead pre-upgrade record first, so an
  ordinary upgrade does not leave both spellings behind. A live pre-upgrade daemon is refused rather
  than overwritten, and both spellings present is reported as ambiguous rather than guessed.

  A folder-wide command reads its space off the runtime records the folder holds. `resolveRuntimeSpace`
  decodes the space out of the record filenames and prefers a space whose record is running over dead
  residue; two spaces running under one root throws and names both. The previous read came from the
  `.cotal/auth` account records, which an open mesh (`broker: { auth: false }`) never writes, so a bare
  `cotal down` in such a folder answered with the default space and walked past its own manager once the
  records became space-keyed.

  `MANAGER_PIDFILE` and `MANAGER_DELIVERY_AWARE_MARKER` move from `pid.ts` to `local-process.ts` and
  are now `{space}` templates; both are still exported from the package index. `RESERVED_COTAL_CHILDREN`
  no longer lists the five root-scoped runtime names.

### Patch Changes

- e703873: Report connector harness availability at manager boot and expose resolved binary paths in status.
- c09d750: Stop answering progress with presence. Textual working rows without an outside last-assistant observation render progress unknown, while heartbeat age remains explicitly labelled as liveness. The render-agnostic observation classifier lives in the workstation layer, not protocol core; compact presence-only glyphs make no progress claim. A stale observation overlays stalled Xm on still-fresh presence.

### Minor Changes

- 7c5995b: Key per-tenant material per space instead of per root. The five root-scoped kinds (the `$SYS` cred pair, `membership.json`, `membership-rw.creds`, `delivery.creds`) and every per-agent standing secret now live under `space.<hex>/` segments, migrated on first touch through one choke point that refuses — loudly, with an honest remedy — on any root it cannot show to hold a single tenant. `space rm`'s step-7 reaps land with their step-1 preconditions ahead of the verb itself. Also: the delivery daemon's `$SYS` repair advice now asks the guard instead of printing commands that refuse on the roots that need them, expired user bearers stop being re-presented on reconnect (with the retry bounded), and `agentSecretKeyForFile` takes the caller's space and checks the recorded path against it, so a stored path can no longer address another tenant's material.

### Minor Changes

- 1f025c3: `cotal spawn` works against a mesh registered from a remote bundle. A user-mode
  agent's credentials must be granted where the space's signer lives, so a laptop
  spawn previously refused with a message about missing local material. A mesh may
  now advertise an agent-provisioning endpoint in its discovery bundle
  (`cotal up --agent-provisioning-url <https://…>`, carried as
  `userAuth.endpoints.agentProvisioningUrl`); spawn POSTs the operator's login
  bearer there, lands the returned material 0600, and runs the same bearer
  preflight before launch. A remote mesh that advertises none now refuses by
  naming that fact and the operator's remedy, instead of blaming absent local
  state. The endpoint is https-only (it receives the login bearer) and redirects
  are refused, matching the registration fetch discipline.

  The login proof itself never crosses the CLI package: the provisioning POST is
  a new optional `AuthProvider.postAgentProvisioning` seam on core's provider
  interface, implemented by `@cotal-ai/auth` — the CLI keeps its no-auth-import
  boundary.

  Also fixes `finalizeUserBundleEndpoint`, which replaced the bundle's endpoints
  object and would have dropped any sibling field the composer set.

### Minor Changes

- 45db9f8: `cotal meshes add` can register a REMOTE mesh. `classifyJoinTarget` gains the `public-tls` reach: with recorded TLS strictness (`tlsRequired: true`) a hostname or public IP literal is registrable, because the TLS chain + hostname check — not the resolver — picks the peer; without it every verdict is unchanged, and RFC1918 stays refused in both modes. **The overlay consent gate no longer applies under required TLS.** `--allow-unencrypted-overlay` exists because an overlay address is only protected while its tunnel is up; with `--tls` (or a `tls://` scheme) the handshake proves the transport instead, so registering an overlay address now needs no flag, prompts for no acceptance, and records none — where previously every overlay registration demanded one. Without required TLS the gate is unchanged. TLS intent is now sourced (a `--tls` flag or a `tls://` scheme) and ENFORCED: the record carries it, the candidate probe honours it, and `meshes add tls://…` against a plaintext broker is a refusal rather than a silent plaintext dial. Remote user-auth registration is built but **fail-closed**: `cotal meshes add --mode user` refuses by default, naming the sequencing, because no connect path can consume a remote entry yet (the auth provider still refuses remote user-mode connects). It is enabled by the remote-exchange client work, which deletes both refusals together. Behind that fence the form is complete: `--mode user` takes its pinned trust supplied — `--user-auth-file <bundle.json>` or `--from <https://…/.well-known/cotal-mesh>` (fetched over HTTPS, pins displayed and confirmed) — verified against the pinned exchange's `/health` + `/jwks` and the broker's own auth-required refusal. Address classification canonicalizes EVERY legacy IPv4 spelling before any verdict. `inet_aton` — which the OS dialer and Node's resolver both accept — takes octal, hex and short forms, so `3232235786`, `0300.0250.01.012`, `0xC0A8010A`, `192.168.257` and `[::ffff:192.168.1.10]` are all the same private addresses that their dotted forms name, and each previously classified as a public hostname and registered while the dotted spelling was refused. They are now refused identically. **This changes verdicts for EVERY alternate spelling, not only private ranges:** a mapped loopback literal now classifies as `loopback`, a mapped overlay literal as `overlay` (so it answers to `--allow-unencrypted-overlay` and can carry a residual), and a mapped public literal as `public-tls` — each one previously fell through to whatever the unnormalized string happened to match. Anything that classified an address in a non-canonical spelling may therefore get a different, dotted-equivalent verdict now. Genuine hostnames are unaffected: a name that is not a valid IPv4 literal in any base (`09.0.0.1`, `999.1.1.1`, `1.2.3.4.5`) stays a hostname. The `--from` discovery fetch and the pinned-exchange probes refuse redirects instead of following them (a 302 can walk an HTTPS fetch onto plaintext or another host), require an `https://` endpoint, and perform no network I/O until the operator has consented to the address. Remote user entries record `userAuth.remote` and a 0600 `sentinelCredsPath` (the path, never the blob), and promote `endpoints.url` to pinned trust; `assertUserAuthInfo` fails loud on both.

### Patch Changes

- b8ee849: Announce the operator-global seed-store payload write, and its deletions, on the provenance channel. `cotal up` and the built-in-connector reconcile re-seed `~/.config/cotal/seed/store/<version>`, which is a machine-wide action (shared by every space, project directory, and checkout on the machine, moved only by `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), yet the store write was previously silent. It now emits a `wrote operator-global seed store payload` provenance line naming the path on each materialization, so re-seeding from a non-released checkout reads as the machine-wide write it is. The idempotent reuse path stays silent.

  The same reconcile also garbage-collects unreferenced store generations, and that was silent too. A new `removed` verb on the provenance channel names every directory the collector deletes, because a silent delete is worse than a silent write: the write at least leaves the thing it made, while the delete leaves nothing to notice. The announce rides stderr with no failure policy, so a closed stderr keeps the write and loses the line; that bound is stated at the call site and in the config reference, which also documents the isolation mechanism.

  The config reference that documents all of this ships inside the connector as well as in the docs tree, so the regenerated documentation bundle carries the same text: an agent asking `cotal_docs` for the configuration page now gets the announce, the removal announce, and the stderr bound along with everything else that page already said.

### Minor Changes

- aa1fe5f: `cotal attach` redeems a session grant with the seed the mesh resolved, never one walked up from the current directory.

  Resolution picks a root from the mesh registry and connects with it; redemption then asked the current directory the same question and used whatever it answered. The two disagree on a real machine rather than in theory, because root detection accepts any directory named `.cotal` and `~/.cotal` exists on every install (the mesh registry lives there). A command run anywhere under `$HOME` outside a project therefore minted its per-session credential from the home directory's trust chain and presented it to a broker that trusts a different one, surfacing as a bare authorization failure that named nothing. The trust material the resolution already carries is now used directly, which is the rule the control layer states for its own re-mints.

  A cwd anchor holding a DIFFERENT chain for the same space is reported rather than obeyed: it cannot change what the command does, but staying silent about it is how the failure stayed a mystery. `@cotal-ai/workspace` gains `divergentCwdAnchor` for that comparison, which is silent on a second checkout of the same mesh and on a directory with no anchor at all.

  The report cannot end the command either. Taking the seed from the resolution stops the current directory choosing which chain is used; it does not by itself stop it ending the run, because the report reads the walked root before the mint and the loader refuses unreadable trust material loudly. A half-written `.cotal/auth/broker.json` anywhere up the walk aborted an attach that had just declared it was not using that root, and on the reconnecting path that fault was retried as though the link were down. A fault reading either root is now reported as nothing to say, which is the accurate answer rather than a fallback: the comparison needs two legible chains, so an unreadable walked root asserts nothing and an unreadable resolved root leaves nothing to compare against. Corruption in the root the command actually reads still surfaces from the path that reads it.

  When the resolved mesh genuinely holds no seed, the refusal now names what the command resolved: the broker and the root. The old sentence named neither the root nor the mesh.

### Minor Changes

- 5634356: `cotal attach` re-establishes its session when the link dies, instead of leaving you with a dead terminal.

  An attach left alone while the laptop slept was gone by the time you came back, in one of two ways
  depending on how long the link was down. Shorter than the serving side's stall watchdog: the
  manager's rail keeps advancing its sequence into a subject nobody is subscribed to, and the session
  transport has no retention, so those frames are gone. The moment the client redials and its
  subscription is restored, the next frame lands far ahead of what the client expected, the rail
  faults, and the CLI exits with `mesh session transport error: gap` about a second after the network
  came back. Longer than the stall: the serving rail fills its window, stalls, ends the session and
  closes, and both of those notices are published while the client is disconnected, so neither is ever
  delivered. On redial the client is subscribed to a session nobody is serving and hangs there with no
  output, no honest end and no exit at all.

  `attach` now owns re-establishment rather than leaving it to the NATS layer. When the link breaks and
  you did not press the detach key, it prints `[cotal: connection lost, reconnecting]` on stderr, then
  asks the manager for a fresh grant, mints a fresh per-session credential, opens a fresh connection
  and a fresh session, prints `[cotal: reconnected]`, and carries on in the same raw-mode terminal.
  The manager repaints the seat's current screen through the path it already uses for any attach.
  Retries wait 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, then 30s, for as long as the seat exists, and the detach key is read
  during the waits between attempts, so a reconnect never traps you. Every attempt re-runs the manager's full authorization, so a
  reconnect cannot keep a revoked or expired grant alive: no grant is ever presented twice.

  Giving up always says why. A manager that refuses the attach exits non-zero with the manager's own
  message; a reconnect that finds the seat no longer there exits cleanly with `seat <name> is gone`. A
  refusal that could still pass, such as a manager at its session ceiling, is relayed in the manager's
  own words while the loop keeps trying, so waiting is never unexplained. Pressing the detach key, or
  the agent's process exiting while you are attached, ends the attach as before.

  Each reconnect also hands the abandoned session back to the manager, over the first link that can
  carry the message, so an attach that rides out several outages does not consume a session slot per
  outage. Nothing on the serving side reaps a session whose caller went away while the seat is quiet:
  the stall watchdog only arms once the send window fills, and an idle seat never fills it. The client
  is the only party that knows, so it says so, using the session's own credential, the only one
  scoped to that session's subjects. If it never gets a link that can carry the message, it says that
  instead, on exit. Every wait on a link that is dying is bounded, and the bound is real: the timer
  that enforces it is what keeps the process alive while a socket that will never answer is waited
  on. A link that stays UP and carries nothing, which is what a sleeping laptop looks like from the
  client, ends with the same clean exit and the same message as any other fault instead of the
  command aborting on a wait that never returned.

  `--no-reconnect` restores the single-session behaviour for scripts that want one run and one exit
  code.

  Under it, `@cotal-ai/workspace` separates a connect refusal from what is done about one. Resolving a
  mesh and its preflight answered every refusal by printing a sentence and ending the process, which is
  right for a person who just typed a command and wrong for a loop riding out a broker that is briefly
  unreachable. The decision now raises a `ConnectRefusal` carrying that exact sentence, and the
  `*OrExit` entry points are thin wrappers that print it and exit as before, so one place writes each
  message and the two forms cannot drift.

### Minor Changes

- 57d3a57: A Claude session publishes a structured event plane, and the `tr-<name>` transcript mirror is
  retired

  A session launched with `cotal spawn --events` now actually publishes. The Claude connector maps
  its session records to structured events behind the same hook relay the mirror used to sit behind:
  run boundaries per turn, assistant text, reasoning, and each tool call with its arguments, its end
  and its result, written to a per-session write-ahead log before they go on the wire so a restart
  resumes at its cursor instead of replaying or skipping. Until now no connector constructed the
  emitter at all, so every event channel was empty.

  The `tr-<name>` mirror is removed in the same change rather than deprecated alongside it. Gone with
  it: the `--transcript` and `--no-transcript` flags on `cotal spawn`, the `transcript` field on the
  manager's spawn op and its service contract, `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT` and `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT`,
  `LaunchOpts.transcript`, `Connector.transcriptChannel`, and the mirror in all three connectors that
  carried one.

  MIGRATION. If you read a `tr-<name>` channel, nothing publishes to it any more. A managed session no
  longer mirrors its prose there under any flag or environment variable, and a spawn that passes
  `--transcript` now fails on an unknown flag rather than being ignored. Read the session's event
  channel instead: launch with `--events` and subscribe to `events.<owner>.<actor>`, which is keyed on
  the session's principal. On a static mesh that is `events.local.<key>`, where the key is what the
  manager allocated and the spawn reply carries it as `id`; on a user-auth mesh it is
  `events.<your-owner>.<agent-name>`, where the actor half is the agent's own name. `connect-claude.md`
  gives both forms. `cotal console` and the web console render event frames directly. Unlike
  `tr-<name>`, you cannot simply subscribe: the plane needs an out-of-band grant, and the command for
  it is under "To let something read a plane" below.

  What you gain and what you lose, both stated. A tool call now arrives with its full arguments, its
  end and its result, in a vocabulary a program can read, where the mirror gave a truncated one-liner
  of glyph-prefixed text. What you lose is prompt text somebody else wrote: the mirror republished
  every prompt, and the event plane withholds the body of a turn the agent did not author, because
  republishing a peer's message onto a channel that peer may not read crosses an ACL boundary. A
  peer-authored turn still opens a run and still shows the work it caused. One stated limit on that,
  because the loss column is only useful if it is complete: a tool result is this session's own output
  and is republished, so peer text quoted inside one still reaches the wire. A cell in
  `agui-authorship.smoke.ts` holds that as a measured limit rather than leaving it to be discovered.

  A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is creating, and no other. A spawn that names
  a different agent's event channel in `allowSubscribe` or `allowPublish` is refused at the door,
  because that channel carries the session's tool inputs and outputs. The same rule runs on a manager
  resume: a retained inventory naming another agent's event channel is refused rather than adopted.

  The rule reads a **concrete** channel, two principal tokens and nothing else. A pattern such as
  `events.<owner>.>` is not an event channel to it and passes untouched, governed by ordinary ACL
  authority. That is deliberate, since the pattern is the form an operator writes on purpose for an
  observer.

  To let something read a plane, grant it out of band. The refusal prints one command, spelled out in
  full, for the mesh it is running on. On a user-auth mesh:
  `cotal actor grant <reader> --owner <owner> --scope '' --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --allow-publish
''`, every field named because `actor grant` is an upsert of the whole row and an omitted flag is the
  wide default (`>` read, `>` post, `spawn,role:default` scope), not "leave it alone". On a static mesh there is no
  actor ledger for `actor grant` to write to, so mint the reader instead:
  `cotal mint watcher --profile agent --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --provision`, the agent profile and
  not the observer one, since `mint` reads `--allow-subscribe` only for that profile and refuses it off
  that profile.

  `cotal mint` now REFUSES `--allow-subscribe` / `--allow-publish` off the agent profile rather than
  ignoring them. Those profiles carry a FIXED read set, the chat plane for observer and the whole
  messaging plane for admin, so
  `--profile observer --allow-subscribe <one channel>` used to exit 0, print a success line, and hand
  out a credential that reads every channel in the space: an operator asking to narrow got the
  opposite, silently. `--role` and `--provision` were already refused there for the same reason. The
  rows in `cli.md` and the sentence in `build-a-client.md` now say the same thing.

### Minor Changes

- 4cf5f72: Give a session's structured event plane a way to be turned on, and a channel that names who is publishing.

  An agent can now be launched with `cotal spawn --events`, foreground or detached, which publishes
  that session's structured event stream, what it did rather than the prose it wrote, on a channel of
  its own so an external observer or UI can read it. Off by default. Nothing about an existing launch
  changes.

  **The channel is named after the principal, never the display name.** It is `events.<owner>.<actor>`,
  derived from the principal the manager actually allocated. A display name is UI convenience: this
  mesh permits two live agents to carry one, and the manager itself auto-numbers a collision, so a
  name-keyed channel would fuse two principals onto one subject and, in auth mode, would authorize both
  onto it from a value that identifies neither. The derivation is a single function on the connector
  contract, `eventChannel`, so the subject the manager grants and the subject the session publishes to
  cannot drift apart. A connector that does not implement it refuses `--events` before any provisioning
  rather than starting a session whose events have nowhere legal to land, and the refusal releases the
  name it had already reserved.

  **The flag and the grant are deliberately separate.** Holding publish rights on a channel is not a
  request to publish to it. An agent file or a manifest can hand-write anything into `allowPublish`, so
  if a grant could arm the plane, any author who could write an agent file could turn on a full
  transcript of another seat's tool inputs and outputs without ever touching the launch grammar. Only
  the launch arms the session; the grant is what makes the arming useful. `cotal_spawn`, the peer-facing
  tool, does not expose the option at all. That is the shape of the tool and not a control-plane refusal:
  the manager's spawn service op is a second door onto the same handler and still accepts the field,
  which is a pre-existing property of that door and is fenced separately.

  **The flag rides the whole launch path, including the record a restart reads.** It is on the
  foreground launch, the detached spawn payload, the manager service contract, and the resume document,
  so a manager restart brings an armed session back armed. The foreground path mints its own grant, from
  the principal it allocated, and passes the workspace root the emitter's write-ahead log needs: a
  session armed by one launch surface and not the other would be a flag that means two different
  things. A resume adopts the credential the spawn wrote rather than minting a new
  one, so what a restart can lose is the record: either the channel leaves `allowPublish`, or the
  arming flag does and the session returns holding publish rights it will never use, which reads as a
  working system with an empty panel. Both halves are now carried and both are asserted.

  **One behaviour change to state plainly.** The foreground launch now passes the mesh's root as the
  launch's workspace root, on every foreground spawn rather than only on an armed one, which is what the
  manager has always done. Two connectors already read that field and root their per-agent home at it:
  Codex, which puts its per-agent home under it, and OpenCode, which puts its database and its serve
  pidfile there. Both previously fell back to the directory the operator happened to run the command
  in. So a foreground Codex or OpenCode session moves its local state from that directory to the mesh
  root, which is where its detached counterpart has always put it. Operators who ran `cotal spawn` from
  somewhere other than the mesh root will find that session's state under the mesh root instead. The
  Claude connector reads the field only on an armed launch, and Hermes and pi do not read it at all.

  **Supporting pieces in the shared connector runtime.** The event vocabulary is exported from
  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` for the first time, so a connector can reach it by package name instead of
  by deep path. The emitter gained a way to close an open run out of band: a harness reports the end of
  a turn through a lifecycle hook that writes no record, so a record-sourced stream previously had no
  vehicle for a turn terminal. The closing frame is an ordinary frame with one exception, it republishes
  the source cursor unchanged, because advancing it would mark records consumed that were never mapped
  and leave a consumer no gap to notice it by. The emitter refuses to close while a message or a tool
  call is still open under the run, while a frame is still pending recovery, and after a halt.

  **One pre-existing limit this makes visible earlier.** In user mode the allocated actor is the display
  name, and principal tokens forbid `-`, which is reserved as the principal name form's separator. The
  manager's collision handling appends `-2`, so the second user-mode launch of any persona has never
  been principal-keyable; it already failed at the identity and provisioning sites. The event grant is
  derived before provisioning, so that launch now fails before it leaves a footprint rather than after.
  The underlying naming limit is unchanged and is not addressed here.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 2752fe7: Stop `cotal ps` waiting on registrations whose host is gone, and give those registrations an exit.

  A class scatter's gather has two exits: every frozen slot answered, or the deadline. The expected set
  is frozen from the service registry, which records registration rather than liveness, and an instance
  that crashes never deregisters, so its record goes on claiming a live instance for as long as the
  bucket exists. That leaves a slot which can never answer, which makes the first exit unreachable, so
  the deadline is paid in full on every scatter in the space, indefinitely. Measured on the laptop this
  was built against: `cotal ps` at 12.5s with one true corpse in the set, ending in a row that read
  `unreachable` for a machine that had been gone for weeks. There was no way to remove that record.
  Three things were wrong, one per layer, and all three are fixed here.

  **The scatter can now be told an instance is gone.** `epScatter` takes an optional `probeLiveness`
  hook and ends the gather once every frozen slot has either produced a valid reply or been affirmed
  gone. It moves the classification point and nothing else: an affirmed-gone slot is still `missing`,
  still surfaced, still not `complete`, and a straggler arriving after an early finish is still reported
  `late` rather than dropped. Only the verdict `gone` licenses anything; `live`, `unknown`, a hook that
  throws, and any value outside the closed set all leave the full deadline standing, so a broken probe
  degrades to exactly the previous behaviour rather than to a fast wrong answer. `epProbeInstanceInterest`
  supplies that verdict from the broker itself: a `describe` cast on the instance's own rail with the
  reserved no-responders sentinel as its reply-to, the same primitive and trust rule `epCall` already
  relies on. A serving incarnation subscribes its instance rail for every command it serves and every
  endpoint must serve `describe`, so silence on that rail is evidence of absence rather than absence of
  evidence. The reply is never read, so an instance whose describe is broken still reads as present.

  **And a probe is never a reason to still be running.** Against a live instance the probe is never
  answered, because the request is a cast and a responder must not reply to one, so its deadline timer
  runs the full budget on every healthy instance every time. Wired into `cotal ps` that was measured at
  four extra seconds after the last row was printed, on a mesh with no dead registration in it at all:
  12.8s with the probe against 8.8s with it switched off, same tree and same mesh. The timer is now
  unref'd, so a probe still settles `unknown` at its budget for anyone waiting on it and no longer holds
  the event loop open for a caller whose gather has already finished. The same measurement after the fix
  is 8.6s to 9.4s.

  **The probe belongs to the caller, not to the scatter.** Asking about an instance is a publish on that
  instance's rail, and a credential holding no row for it is refused by the broker asynchronously while
  the publish returns normally, so a refused probe is silent and silence is what a live but slow instance
  looks like. Core cannot tell those apart because core does not know what the credential carries. So
  `epScatterService` forwards a caller-supplied hook and never invents one, and the CLI supplies a closure
  that returns `unknown` without publishing for any id outside its pinned set, and reports a refusal the
  broker raises anyway instead of letting it expire into a timeout. That refusal is attributed to the
  instance its own subject names, parsed as an exact route token, so one refusal is never charged to a
  second frozen instance whose id happens to be a prefix of the refused one. `cotal ps` freezes the class on its
  first connection, re-mints an instrument pinned to exactly the frozen ids, and resolves and scatters on
  a second. `instancePinnedInstrumentCapabilities` accepts several ids as well as one; each still emits
  its own concrete rows, so no wildcard instance is minted and the existing boundary on instance
  addressing is unchanged.

  **A registration now has an exit, in two explicit routes.** A manager that stops cleanly deletes its own
  `svc` spec and status keys, so an instance that was shut down leaves no row behind; a manager that loses
  its lease still tears down fail-closed and deliberately does not deregister, because at that point it is
  not the authority on its own record. For the host that cannot cooperate, `cotal deregister-instance
--instance <id>` removes the record, on the same evidence the scatter acts on and no weaker: it asks the
  instance first and refuses if it answers, refuses if the probe could not run at all, refuses if the
  instance is merely quiet, and deletes both keys at the revisions it read only when the broker affirms
  that nothing is subscribed on that instance's own rail. Silence is never the evidence, because a wedged
  process still holds its subscriptions and an unanswered describe is what a dead host, a hung one and a
  slow one all look like. A dead process holds no subscription, so a real corpse still deletes. Nothing
  sweeps the registry on age or on silence. Registering over a deregistration tombstone now works on both
  keys, so a deregistered instance re-registers normally on its next start, with its epoch advancing.

  **Rows split by what was actually established.** A silent instance already printed as registered with
  no answer rather than as unreachable. Now that a probe exists, the four cases behind that one sentence
  are distinguished: a registration the broker affirms is gone says the registration is stale and prints
  the command that removes it, a probe that was refused and one that was never sent each say so, because
  both are facts about the command rather than about the instance, and asked-and-silent keeps the wording
  it has, since a slow host and a wedged one are the same observation.

  **And one layer down, the same shape.** The manager writes `.cotal/manager.pid` itself rather than
  having it written by whatever spawned it, so a supervisor started by a container entrypoint, by cron, or
  by hand is recorded like a detached `cotal up` is; the record is removed on a clean stop, and only while
  it still names that process. Every reader now verifies the recorded pid is alive and is a supervisor
  before trusting it, and a live pid that belongs to something else is reported as a stale record and
  never signalled.

  This does not help against an instance that is connected but not answering. A hung responder holds its
  subscriptions and is indistinguishable from a slow one, so it still costs the full deadline, which is
  the correct result, and the removal verb refuses it for the same reason rather than unregistering a
  process that is still running. A scatter with no probe wired behaves exactly as before.

### Patch Changes

- 24687a3: Resolve a local project against the mesh recorded for its root, whatever spelling that root arrives
  under.

  `resolveMeshTarget` looks up the registry entry recorded for the current project root and honours its
  `server` and `mode`. That lookup compared roots with `resolve()`, which normalizes separators and
  `..`/`.` but does not collapse a symlink. A recorded root is whatever spelling the operator gave:
  `cotal meshes add --root <dir>` runs its root through `resolve()` too, never realpath, so a project
  recorded under one spelling of its directory and started under another read as _unrecorded_: its
  recorded server and mode were discarded and it was silently retargeted to the default server. A
  project started on `…:4333` resolved to `…:4222`, and a recorded open mesh minted credentials off
  stale local auth state. Both comparisons now use the canonical root predicate the registry already
  applies in `meshesForRoot`, which is now exported rather than reimplemented at each call site.

- 17f14be: Name which install is behind when an extension fails to import a missing `@cotal-ai/*` export. The
  error used to prescribe `cotal ext add <extension>` for every import failure, which reinstalls
  whichever side is current: when the linked core is the older one, no reinstall of the extension can
  supply the export, so the prescribed command changes nothing. It now names the missing symbol, the
  peer copy that was actually linked (with its version and path), and the side that is behind. When the
  core is behind, or is the same version but an older build, it prescribes an exact command for the
  copy it just named: a pinned `npm i -g cotal-ai@<version>` for an installed copy, or a rebuild for a
  source checkout, where that command would be wrong. It keeps the `cotal ext add` remedy only when the
  extension is the older side, and refuses to name a side at all when the two cannot be ranked.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 665b378: Gate which broker addresses a mesh may be registered at, and make the unsafe one an explicit choice.

  Registering a mesh is how a machine starts sending agent credentials to a broker it does not run,
  and nothing here can require an encrypted connection yet. NATS announces itself in plaintext
  before anyone authenticates, so an attacker on the path can pose as the broker and read the
  credential straight out of the connect; a `tls://` URL does not prevent it, because it is the
  connect options rather than the scheme that make the client insist on TLS.

  `cotal meshes add` therefore gates on the address. Loopback literals (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`) are
  permitted because nothing leaves the machine. Private-overlay literals (`100.64.0.0/10`,
  `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`) require `--allow-unencrypted-overlay`, an explicit acceptance that is
  recorded on the mesh entry: they ride an encrypted tunnel only while that tunnel is actually up,
  and with it down the range is ordinary carrier-grade NAT that hostile routing can answer. A
  printed warning was not enough — stderr is not read by scripts, and it was not persisted, so
  nothing repeated it at the dials that followed. Everything else is refused, including ordinary
  private ranges such as `10.x` and `192.168.x` — a café network is private too, and private is not
  the same as yours.

  Registering an authenticated mesh also copies that mesh's `.cotal/auth`, which carries the space's
  account **signing seed**: a machine holding it can mint any identity in the space until the signing
  key is rotated and every credential re-minted. The docs and the guided form now say so where the
  operator reads them, and `cotal mint` alone does not substitute (registration needs signing
  material that composes).

  **Scope, stated precisely so this is not read as more.** This gates NEW REGISTRATIONS, and only
  those. It is not a client-side dial fence: a record written before this change, or a `--server`
  override, reaches the broker through the ordinary connect path without consulting it. Calling the
  join path "protected" or "made safe" would be wrong. Fencing the credential-bearing dial itself
  is separate work.

  Hostnames are refused as well, even ones that resolve somewhere permitted, because otherwise
  whoever answers the lookup decides which machine receives the credentials. The check runs before
  `--force`, which exists for a mesh that is temporarily down and never waives it.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- fd361fe: Serve the broker over TLS: the transport foundation, with the omission cases made unrepresentable.

  `serverConfig` and the new `openServerConfig` take a REQUIRED `transport` discriminated union
  (`plaintext` | `tls-required { certFile, keyFile }`) instead of an optional TLS field, and
  `standaloneConnectOpts` now requires an explicit `tls` boolean with no default. Both are breaking,
  and both are deliberate: an optional transport is omitted by default, and the omitted case is the
  dangerous one. A client with no TLS requirement still connects to a TLS broker — it upgrades the
  same socket after reading the server's unauthenticated `INFO` — so nothing looks wrong until an
  on-path attacker forges an `INFO` without `tls_required` and collects the credentials that a NATS
  client sends in its `CONNECT` line.

  Also in this change:

  - `cotal up`'s open (no-auth) mode now renders a config instead of launching from bare CLI flags, so
    no path reaches a listener without naming its transport. Previously a cert/key pair given to an
    open-mode `up` would have been accepted while the broker came up in cleartext.
  - `validateTlsMaterial` checks readability, private-key mode, pair match, validity window and
    dial-host SAN before the broker starts, because `nats-server` does not: it reports an expired
    certificate valid, starts, and serves it, and only the client fails.
  - `probeServedCert` / `assertServedCertMatches` complete a real STARTTLS upgrade and read back the
    leaf actually being served, so a rotation is proved rather than assumed. Renewing files on disk
    does not reload `nats-server`.
  - A durable broker launch policy records the transport so a TLS decision survives `cotal down`, and
    refuses rather than degrading when it cannot be honoured.
  - `MeshEntry.tlsRequired` carries TLS-required client intent (never cert paths) through to
    `Connection` and `endpointAuth`, so a CLI-resolved connection inherits the recorded decision.

  `allow_non_tls` is never emitted: it is mixed mode, and a client that declines the upgrade is served
  in cleartext. `handshake_first` and `verify`/`verify_and_map` are likewise never emitted — mTLS is a
  deliberate non-goal, since identity here is JWT/NKey plus the auth callout.

  ## What this guarantees, and what it does not

  **The guarantee.** `cotal up --tls-cert <cert> --tls-key <key>` either serves TLS or refuses to
  start. There is no third outcome. The transport is decided once, above every branch in `up`, so the
  manifest (`-f`), `--detach`, refresh and restore routes cannot reach a listener without naming it;
  each route re-checks the certificate against the host clients will actually dial. A running broker
  cannot change its transport, so passing the flags to an already-running mesh is refused rather than
  answered with a success line. The decision is recorded, so a later bare `cotal up` after a
  `cotal down` keeps serving TLS instead of silently reverting to cleartext.

  **A direct `CotalEndpoint` construction still defaults to plaintext.** `EndpointOptions.tls` remains
  optional and absent still means "no TLS required". If you build an endpoint yourself rather than
  going through `cotal up` or a resolved mesh record, you must pass `tls: true`; nothing will tell you
  otherwise, and the connection will succeed either way against a TLS broker because a NATS client
  upgrades the same socket once it reads the server's `INFO`. Making that field required is a tracked
  follow-up. It is called out here because "Cotal supports TLS" is not something you should be able to
  believe while your own client is connecting without requiring it.

  **Client-side strictness is NOT complete, and the honest scope is wider than a short list.** The
  broker refuses cleartext, so none of these connects in the clear against a healthy TLS broker — a
  NATS client upgrades the same socket once it reads `tls_required`. What they lack is their own
  requirement, which is the fence against a stripped or forged `INFO`, and that is the whole reason
  this feature exists.

  Two distinct cases, and the second is worse:

  _Never had a TLS path / passes `tls: false` explicitly._ `waitForDeliveryLease`
  (`packages/core/src/lease.ts`) builds its own `connect` options rather than going through
  `standaloneConnectOpts`. The user-auth service and the membership feed connect the same way.
  The **enumerated** `standaloneConnectOpts({ … tls: false })` sites at this tip (twelve, not a
  prose list) are:

  | File                                       | Lines              | Role                                                                                                                                                              |

  | `implementations/cli/src/commands/up.ts`   | 1155, 1234         | `provePreparedRestoreListener` / `proveOrdinaryResumeListener` authenticated JetStream proof (restore + ordinary-resume adopt only — not bare `up` / bare `down`) |
  | `implementations/cli/src/commands/down.ts` | 651, 691           | `assertControlPlaneQuiesced` / `readPresenceWithoutConsumer` — **only** on `down --preserve-state`, not bare `cotal down`                                         |

  Bare `cotal down` does **not** hit those two `down.ts` sites: it stops via pidfiles
  (`stopLocalProcess`) and never opens a broker wire. Live-checked twice: `up --detach --open
--tls-cert/--tls-key` then bare `down` (with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` stripped on the down step) stops
  manager, delivery, and nats-server and leaves the port `ECONNREFUSED`. There is no silently-skipped
  safety gate on ordinary teardown.

  `down --preserve-state` is the only path that calls `assertControlPlaneQuiesced` (via
  `isReachable(mesh.server)` at `down.ts:585`, then the `tls: false` connects at :651/:691). Bare
  `isReachable(server)` is a plaintext INFO probe (`tcpInfoProbe`): on this branch's STARTTLS TLS it
  still returns **true** (INFO precedes the upgrade), so the quiescence gate is **entered**, not
  skipped, when the client trusts the CA. **Narrow residual (do not fix in this branch):**
  `down --preserve-state` **and** a CA the client does not trust — then a stricter `{tls:true}` probe
  would fail, the INFO probe still says up, and the subsequent authenticated connect without a trusted
  CA fails or the cut proceeds without a completed wire-truth lease proof depending on the failure
  mode. Same family as the private-CA diagnosis gap (S7); incomplete client fence, not an ordinary-path
  break. Flagless sites mostly **work** via auto-upgrade and are **unfenced** (no own requirement
  against a forged INFO), not "broken teardown."

  _Resolves the decision and then drops it (partially closed)._ `cotal web` now passes
  `tls: conn.tls` into its endpoint. `cotal status` carries `target.tlsRequired` on the Selected Mesh
  preflight, the open/auth live snapshot, the user-mode connection probe and user live snapshot, and
  the Recorded Meshes liveness check — a mesh recorded `tlsRequired: true` is not greened by a bare
  TCP/INFO probe against a plaintext substitute. What still drops the decision: the mesh manager
  (`startManagerDetached`'s options type has no `tls` field, so `ensureControlPlane` forwards `--tls`
  to the delivery daemon and then launches the manager without it), plus the never-had-a-path sites
  above.

  Client-side strictness landed for: `cotal up` (every route to a listener), the recorded mesh record
  (`MeshEntry.tlsRequired`), CLI-resolved connections that go through `resolveMeshTarget` /
  `endpointAuth`, `cotal status`, `cotal web`, and the delivery daemon's three dials. It has not
  landed for the manager process, the user-auth service, the membership feed, `waitForDeliveryLease`,
  or the twelve helper sites tabulated above. That table is the residual enumeration; do not collapse
  it back to prose.

  The delivery daemon is strict on all three of its dials, including the every-two-seconds reachability
  poll that re-presents its standing credential for the life of the process.

  **Also not included:** the `cotals://` handout from `up`; a rotation command; and `tls://` as a
  _server_ scheme enforcing anything (it is cosmetic at the client: nats.js connects plaintext to
  `tls://host` with empty options, and only the explicit `tls` option refuses). **Changing transport
  on a live broker is restart-only by construction:** passing `--tls-cert/--tls-key` (or dropping
  them) against an already-running mesh is refused — `cotal down`, then `cotal up` with the desired
  flags. A reload of `nats-server` is not offered, because it would leave established plaintext
  sessions alive.

  Operators using a private CA need `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, because `EndpointOptions.tls` is a boolean
  and cannot carry a CA file. The private-key permission check is POSIX-only.

  **S10 (fixed in this change):** a `tlsRequired` registry entry used to be **pruned** when a
  `connectOrExit` / `preflightOrExit` path ran without a trusted CA. `preflightTarget` probes with
  `{tls:true}`; certificate verification failure was classified as `unreachable` (prune:true), so
  `cotal send dm …` (and any other preflighted command) deleted a healthy mesh record on a recoverable
  trust error — durable state destroyed because the operator forgot `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Fix: when
  the recorded target requires TLS and the TLS probe fails as unreachable, confirm plaintext INFO
  still advertises `tls_required: true` (with a second, longer read before condemning); if it does,
  classify as `tls-trust` with **prune:false**. That proves a TLS-required NATS listener is present —
  INFO is unauthenticated and is not mesh identity — so the record is conservatively kept and the
  operator is told to fix the trust store (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`). A plaintext substitute on the same
  port does not advertise `tls_required` and still follows the normal unreachable/prune path.
  Live-checked both ways.

  **Named follow-ups (not fixed here):**

  - Defence-in-depth only: pass `mesh.tlsRequired ? {tls:true}:{}` at `down.ts:418`/`:585` and thread
    transport into `:651`/`:691` (measurement showed bare INFO already enters the preserve-state
    quiescence gate when the CA is trusted).
  - Bare `cotal down` pidfile-trust: hiding manager/delivery pidfiles while those processes still run
    lets bare down stop the broker and report success (pre-existing; filed separately).

- 019afc3: The manager control surface gains three capabilities on the v0.4 endpoint rails: spawn as an action, multi-manager instance addressing, and attach as a mesh session.

  Spawn and launch are now actions (SPEC 13.6). Asking the manager for an agent no longer blocks the caller while the process comes up: the manager accepts a spawn goal and returns the allocated identity at once (`{name, owner, actor, uid, goalId, fingerprint, executor{lifecycleUid, epoch}}`), then progress events follow the launch to a terminal outcome. Presence within the readiness window settles the goal `succeeded`, an early exit `failed`, and the window elapsing with neither is `uncertain` (a bounded, durable outcome a later `ps` settles against the live roster, never a silent hang). A persona-derived name collision auto-numbers; a hard-pinned `--name` colliding with a live agent refuses at accept, before anything is minted. The `--detach` CLI spawn, the manifest `-f` launch, and the connector's `cotal_spawn` submit and follow to the terminal, so their behavior is unchanged. The goal terminal is fenced to the executing manager's own gate epoch (the terminal lands on an epoch-scoped result subject), so a superseded incarnation's terminal is invisible to current readers; a durable reconcile index lets a restarted manager settle any goal a predecessor accepted but never terminalized. The goal-fact writer is a dedicated, family-staged, renewed credential disjoint from the serve credential.

  One space can now run more than one manager. Each manager persists a stable logical instance id across restarts and advances its process epoch when it comes back, so peers address a specific manager regardless of which process currently serves it; a restart re-registers the same instance and evicts its predecessor's serve family through a scoped, one-registration eviction credential. `cotal spawn --on <instance>` pins one instance by its exact id, an untargeted spawn rides class anycast (the acceptance records which instance took it), and `cotal ps` / `status` become a class scatter that merges every registered instance's rows with per-instance attribution and labels a non-answering instance unreachable, never omitting it. The manager lease is demoted from a per-space singleton to per-instance liveness (loss stops only that instance's serving, never the space), reconcile touches only rows the instance owns, and the retirement rail authorizes on the registration gate rather than a name-derived holder, so a deposed predecessor cannot retire a target.

  `cotal attach` no longer returns a `127.0.0.1` websocket URL. It creates a one-use, holder-bound session over the mesh: the reply carries a signed session grant (no URL, never logged), redeemed once, after which terminal bytes stream on session subjects scoped to the two parties, with backpressure surfaced as an explicit drop notice. A late attach still repaints the full screen from a replayed terminal snapshot, and close, expiry, target despawn, and manager restart are distinct, surfaced end states. The browser console is now a real mesh session client over a served bundle (the broker gains a localhost-default websocket listener), holding only a per-session, rails-only credential that expires with the session. The manager's session writer is a scoped, family-staged, renewed credential over a dedicated sessions store.

- f85ffbf: The manager now registers itself as an ordinary v0.4 `service` endpoint (`manager`) on every static auth mesh and dual-serves its FULL typed command surface on the endpoint rails beside the existing control tiers — nothing removed yet. The served commands mirror every control op through the same handler cores: `status`, `ps`, `inspect` (per-agent read), `models`, `spawn` (the full 16-field launch surface), targeted owner-mode `despawn`/`attach`, the baseline self-mode `stop`, `define-persona`, `purge`, `launch`, the resume/preservation family, and the reserved `describe`. `ps`/`inspect`/`spawn` replies now also carry each agent's `lifecycleUid` (the coordinate a targeted request pins). Core gains the production endpoint-serve credential subsystem over the durable auth store: the §13.1 endpoint issuance gate and serve ledger (`epgate…`/`epcred…`), the registration barrier with fail-closed eviction, and the serve-mint release fence — plus a key-pinned one-shot `endpoint-serve-executor` credential profile scoped to exactly one endpoint instance's gate, serve-ledger family, and registration record keys. The manager drives its registration and every serve-credential mint and renewal through that scoped executor connection (never its standing supervisor connection), applies one shared lifecycle-membership + maintenance admission gate on both control doors (the legacy `ctl` tiers and the new endpoint rails), and renews its bounded serve credential on the standing renewal pass. Registration also publishes the manager's §13.7 contract artifacts — every command's schema root, its closure manifest, and the cluster document — to the per-space content-addressed contract store (created create-or-verify at manager start alongside the authority stores), and every agent credential's baseline now carries the store's read grant, so any caller can fetch, verify, and recompile the registered schema digests without out-of-band contract sharing.

  The control CONSUMERS now ride those rails (static-auth meshes): every CLI manager call (`spawn --detach`, `ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `models`, `down`/`up`'s resume and preservation phases) and every connector supervision tool (`cotal_spawn`/`cotal_despawn`/`cotal_persona`, self-stop, history purge) goes through the generic invoke path - describe, fetch the registered schemas from the contract store, recompile digest-verified validators, invoke - instead of hand-importing the manager's contracts; invoke currency is describe-bound (the answering incarnation's broker-authenticated identity), so a superseded or split-brain manager refuses instead of answering stale. New `cotal describe <endpoint>` and `cotal invoke <endpoint> <command>` expose the same generic surface to operators. Operator reach is now minted, not door-refined: `control-caller-privileged`/`control-caller-admin`/`deployer` instrument credentials carry tier-matched endpoint capability rows (the admin tier's cross-agent `despawn`/`attach` ride the operator-only `any` authorization mode, declared in the manager's revision-3 cluster document), the spawn capability additionally mints `define-persona` + `inspect`, and an `admin`-capability credential mirrors the full admin instrument set. Open meshes and user-mode bearers kept the legacy `ctl` path until the final slice below.

  User-mode meshes join the migration end to end: the manager registers its v0.4 service on per-user meshes too (the registration/serve machinery is operator infrastructure riding the space's static trust material), the CLI's bearer path derives its caller triple from the bearer's ledger lifecycle claim, the connector's endpoint identity is its triple in every auth mode (no ctl branch left in the connector), and `spawn -f`'s deploy probe drives `ps`/`launch` over the generic invoke path for both the static admin credential and the user-mode deployer view. Serve-side hardening: every `manager.admin`-class command (purge, launch, and the resume/preservation family) re-checks operator reach at serve time against the caller's CURRENT ledger scope on user meshes, so a revoked `admin` scope demotes the next call instead of riding out the bearer's remaining row lifetime.

  The migration is now complete: the manager's legacy `ctl` control rail is deleted. Core drops the `manager`/`self`/`admin` control tiers, the `ControlTier` type, and `controlSubject`; the server-side `ctl.delivery`/`ctl.delivery-admin`/`ctl.auth-admin` rails (the delivery daemon's and auth service's own carve-outs) are unchanged. Every credential profile is endpoint-only: agent baselines lose the `ctl.self` publish and control-reply subscribe rows, the supervisor serves no control tier, and the operator instruments carry endpoint capability rows only, so the old manager control subjects are unreachable end to end (publish rows, serve subscriptions, and handlers are all gone). The manager registers its `service` endpoint on EVERY mesh: auth meshes ride the scoped endpoint-serve executor; open meshes run the same gate/registration/serve-grant ceremony over bare one-shot connections (no credential is ever minted; the broker enforces nothing on an open mesh) and create-or-verify the authority stores at boot, so a raw broker no longer dies at the first gate write. The CLI's control layer replaces `ControlTier` with `ControlReach` (`owner`/`any`): the target's authorization mode derives from the resolved target owner (an own-domain target rides owner mode; a cross-owner target rides any mode, which the broker admits only for admin-instrument holders), open meshes ride a bare caller triple, and a raw `--creds` control caller without an endpoint caller identity refuses loud instead of falling back. `ps`/`inspect` rows pin `role` as optional (a manifest-launched agent declares none, and the reply schema previously failed the responder's own output).

- 11cd652: `cotal ps` on a user-auth mesh no longer class-scatters.

  **Why.** The class scatter freezes the live manager set via a records-bucket `STREAM.INFO` read that only the static `control-caller-privileged` instrument holds. A user-mode bearer never has that row, so scatter died on a permissions violation that read as "no manager" — even when a manager was up and would have answered `ep.one.manager.ps`. Measured: an admin-scoped user bearer is served on `ep.one`; the same bearer is refused on the freeze.

  **What changes.** Mode is chosen up front from the connection shape, never try-scatter-catch-degrade:

  - **User-auth:** `ep.one` to one manager (in-memory roster, owner-filtered). Multi-manager completeness is not claimed; an unreachable manager fails the command rather than printing a bare empty list.
  - **Static / open:** class scatter unchanged (freeze + per-instance attribution, unreachable labeled).

  `connectOrExit` now refuses a `control-caller-*` instrument request on a user-mode mesh (those profiles are static-only); `resolveControlTarget` translates to the user bearer path explicitly. `deployer` is unchanged (real `userViewAuth` elevation). Docs state the user-mode completeness bound. Gated: `smoke:ps-operator-path` (static + dead-manager honesty) and `smoke:ps-user-mode` (user path + dead-manager non-zero).

  **Known limitation.** This fix's correctness relies on the ep tier boundary asserted at `user-spawn.smoke.ts` B1e (a spawn-scope bearer's `ps` is broker-dropped). That suite is **not** in the `smoke:ci` chain, so the invariant is unprotected by CI. Gating it is out of scope here and is tracked separately.

- 185e721: Renew the `$SYS` credentials without tearing the space down.

  `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are signed by
  the system-account seed, which is never persisted, so nothing re-signs them in place. The only
  repair the tooling named was "`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`", and that did nothing: `up`
  mints the pair only on the branch that _creates_ the trust record, so re-upping a provisioned space
  reused the same expired files and reported success. A long-running mesh therefore lost its
  membership feed and live connection eviction every 30 days with no supported way back.

  `cotal up --rotate-sys` is that way back. It issues a new system account under the same broker
  operator, mints both `$SYS` creds against it, and renders the broker config from the rotated record,
  so the broker it starts is the one that trusts them. The data account, the account signing key,
  every agent credential minted from it and the JetStream store are untouched; what dies is the
  retired system account, on every broker that loads the rotated config. It is refused wherever the
  on-disk material and the broker could end up on different generations: a running mesh; an open mesh,
  whether that comes from `--open` or from `broker.auth: false` in a manifest; `--restore`; an
  unfinished restore or resume attempt on the root, including one a bare `cotal up` would recover,
  since those paths can adopt a live listener and return without booting a broker; and a root hosting
  more than one space, because the system account lives in the shared broker record and the rotation is
  therefore broker-wide. `rotateSystemCreds` is exported from `@cotal-ai/workspace` and carries the
  multi-tenant guard itself rather than at the CLI flag. It is deliberately a workstation operation and
  takes no `SecretStore`: the `$SYS` pair has no store seam to be written through, and because a
  `SecretStore` cannot be enumerated, accepting one would mean a broker-wide guard that reads a local
  filesystem while enforcing nothing for the tenants actually at risk.

  A rotation requires every broker for the root to be stopped, and three checks now say so: this root's
  recorded mesh at the requested address, anything unidentified answering there (which refuses instead
  of relocating to a free port), and the root's own ownership records: a live or unreadable `nats.pid`,
  or any recorded mesh for this root still reachable. Without them a lost registry row, or a
  `nats-server` started by hand against this root's `server.conf`, was enough to bypass the running-mesh
  refusal: `up` found the port busy, picked a free one, rotated, and left the old broker serving the
  retired config while a second one ran against the same JetStream store. These are Cotal's ownership
  records rather than a scan of the process table, and the docs say so: a hand-started broker on a
  different port writes none of them and is the named residual.

  Two consequences the tooling now states rather than leaving to be discovered. The retirement is
  config-load-bound, so a stale broker still running the previous config keeps honouring the old creds
  until it is stopped. And a full backup binds to the trust chain it was taken against, which includes
  the operator JWT and the system account, so every full artifact taken before a rotation refuses to
  restore afterwards: the rotation says so as it happens, and `cotal up --restore` names the drift when
  the data account still matches. The commit is a trust-record write plus two credential writes, so an
  interrupted rotation leaves the record ahead of the creds; that split is detected rather than
  silent. One shared check compares each `$SYS` cred's issuer against the persisted record, and it
  runs on every auth-mesh boot as well as in `cotal doctor auth`, so the state cannot pass unremarked
  by a mesh that simply never runs the doctor. The boot REFUSES rather than warning: a warning becomes an unread log line
  under `--detach`'s success output, and live connection eviction rides the same credential pair, so
  booting would silently downgrade revocation to deny-new for the life of the mesh. The delivery daemon, which never
  loads the signer and so cannot read the record, compares the two creds against each other instead.

  The recovery is covered end-to-end as well as in unit form: a suite drives the packaged binary
  against a real broker, a real delivery daemon and a real manager, on a root whose `$SYS` pair is
  already past its horizon. It asserts the reported symptom (the daemon's membership feed does not
  start, and says which credential and which repair), that `down` + a plain `up` leaves both files
  byte-identical and the doctor red, and that `down` + `up --rotate-sys` clears it in the daemon that
  reported it. The survival claim is checked rather than asserted: an agent credential minted before
  the rotation still connects afterwards, the CHAT stream returns at the same sequence and count, and
  registry state written before the rotation reads back through the CLI after it.

  Diagnosis now names the cause instead of the symptom. An expired observer cred used to surface as a
  bare "Authorization Violation" in the delivery log and, one layer up, as a `membership-rw` adoption
  refused with "membership feed is not running", neither of which mentions a credential. The daemon
  checks the observer's own expiry before connecting and reports it, carries that reason into the
  adoption reply, and the manager warns on every renewal pass from the 75% point onward rather than
  letting the mesh discover the expiry at the horizon. `cotal doctor auth`, `evictPrincipal`,
  `planeConnLiveness` and the two mint errors now print the repair that works. Where the feed is down
  because its bundle is incomplete rather than expired, the daemon now names the missing files and
  distinguishes the two cases: a missing `$SYS` observer is re-minted by a rotation, while a space
  predating broker-sourced membership is missing the rw cred and the account id as well, which a
  rotation does not write, so it is told the truth rather than sent through a stop/start that cannot
  help it.

### Patch Changes

- 14ff831: Stop reading another user's live process as dead.

  Asking the kernel about a process has three answers, not two: it is there, it is gone, or it is
  there but not ours to signal (`EPERM`). A two-state probe folds the third into "gone", and the
  caller then acts on a running process as if it had died.

  The repo already had a tri-state contract that gets this right, documenting itself as "consumed
  everywhere". Two production files imported it. Sixteen other production call sites probed inline,
  and **seven of the fourteen files handled `EPERM` correctly on their own while seven did not**, so
  this was a coin flip repeated fourteen times rather than one broken helper.

  Fixed, with the wrong answer named at each site:

  | site                       | what the old probe did                                                                        |
  | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `manager-proc.managerUp`   | reported no manager, so `ensureManager` starts a second one onto a live one                   |
  | `delivery-proc.deliveryUp` | same, for the delivery daemon: two daemons on one fanout                                      |
  | `auth` `agent-bearer`      | "the user-auth service is not running, restart it with `cotal up`" about a service that is up |
  | `auth` provider            | same misread on the readiness path                                                            |
  | `cli ext`                  | printed "stale pidfile" about a live extension, which is advice to delete it                  |

  Both `up` functions also parsed their pidfile with `Number.isFinite`, which admits fractional and
  out-of-range values `process.kill` throws on. They now use the contract's bounded parser.

  The contract moved from `implementations/cli/src/lib/pid.ts` to `@cotal-ai/workspace`, the widest
  tier that may hold a local-process concept. **"Consumed everywhere" was never reachable and the
  claim hid the gap:** `extensions/*` peer-depend `core` only, and a pid probe is not a wire concept,
  so reaching them would mean leaking a local concern into the standard. The two extension-side
  probes keep their own copies by construction, and the module now says so instead of overclaiming.

  Presence questions require PROOF (`=== "alive"`); only destructive questions preserve on doubt
  (`!== "dead"`, which is why `down.ts` is written that way and is untouched). An earlier revision of
  this change had the presence sites preserving too, and review reproduced what that buys: a permanent,
  silent, retry-proof false-up, where the control plane reports `running: true` three times over
  against an unreachable manager. The demonstrated defect was `EPERM` alone, and widening past it was
  unforced.

  Covered by a new broker-free suite, `smoke:pid-contract`. The errno-to-state mapping is a pure
  exported function tested exhaustively, so there is no fixture to skip: the first revision reached the
  `EPERM` rule only by probing pid 1 and hoping the process was unprivileged, and as root or in a
  container that cell skipped while the suite still printed a passing banner over a deliberately broken
  implementation. The suite also drives the CONVERTED CALLERS through real pidfiles, because the first
  revision tested only the primitive and a reviewer inverted all five call sites without reddening a
  single check.

  `unknown` is REACHABLE on a real kernel, not merely under a test shim. A Linux seccomp
  `SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO` filter, or an LSM policy through `security_task_kill()`, can answer
  `kill(pid, 0)` with an arbitrary errno without executing it, and libuv preserves it. Review proved
  this with a live seccomp BPF filter and no interposition. So both ways of folding the third state
  into a boolean are wrong, and both fail SILENTLY: preserving reports a control plane that is not
  there and no retry clears it, while requiring proof launches a second manager over one that may be
  live.

  `ensureManager` and `ensureDelivery` therefore REFUSE on `unknown`, loudly, naming the pid, naming
  seccomp/LSM as the expected cause inside sandboxes, and saying what to check. `managerLiveness` and
  `deliveryLiveness` expose the state the booleans cannot carry; `managerUp`/`deliveryUp` remain
  `=== "alive"` for display, with a doc note sending any caller that ACTS on the answer to the
  tri-state.

  Honest coverage limit, stated in the suite's own output rather than implied away: no cell here
  exercises `unknown`, because no `parsePid`-accepted input produces one from this process. The refusal
  is verified by a seccomp BPF harness outside the suite.

### Minor Changes

- 531d37d: Register, list and unregister meshes from the CLI.

  `cotal meshes add <space> --server <url> [--root <dir>] [--mode auth|open]` records a mesh this
  machine did not start — one running on another machine, a shared broker, a hosted space — so
  `--space`, `cotal use` and a bare `cotal spawn` can reach it from any directory. The broker is
  probed before anything is written, so a wrong address or credentials that mesh will not accept fail
  at registration instead of at the first spawn; `--force` records without verifying and replaces an existing
  record. `cotal meshes rm <space> …` drops records (never stopping a mesh: a mesh running here is
  refused in favour of `cotal down`) and releases the `current` pointer when it pointed at one.

  Registry records now carry an origin, and an automatic prune only ever deletes records that
  `cotal up` wrote. A record added by hand cannot be reconstructed by this machine, so an unreachable
  broker under one is reported — `offline` in `cotal meshes`, and a preflight failure that names
  `cotal meshes rm` rather than `cotal up` — instead of silently unregistering a mesh that was live
  all along.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f89560a: New Codex connector (`--agent codex`): an OpenAI Codex session as a full lateral mesh peer, in Codex's own TUI. A host-mode peer drives a `codex app-server` thread over JSON-RPC: inbound batches wake a real turn, and directed messages steer INTO a live turn mid-flight.

  `cotal spawn --agent codex` opens Codex's own TUI. The app-server runs as a loopback websocket listener guarded by a per-incarnation capability token (0600, inside the agent's private home), and the TUI attaches to the very thread the mesh drives, so mesh turns render as they happen and anything you type is a real user turn on that same thread. With no terminal (piped output, CI, a smoke) the host stays headless with an activity feed instead; `COTAL_CODEX_TUI=1|0` picks the mode explicitly when the tty check would guess wrong. Once Codex owns the terminal the host's own log moves to `host.log` in the agent's private home, and the handoff line names that path so a later failure is findable.

  The shared `cotal_*` tools are served by the host process itself over a bearer-authenticated loopback MCP endpoint, with the token passed to codex by env var name so it never reaches the process table. Because the app-server is the MCP client, the same tools work on a mesh-driven turn and on one typed into the TUI; the connector's own tools are pre-approved so an unattended agent never stalls on an approval prompt nobody is watching, and `mcp_servers.cotal.*` is reserved and refused rather than silently overridden.

  Autonomy defaults suit an agent woken by peer messages when nobody is watching: `approval_policy=never` (never ask before running a command, not refuse), `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, and `sandbox_workspace_write={network_access=true}`. Network is on because Codex's own workspace-write default has it off, which breaks installing a dependency or pushing a branch with an error that reads like the task is impossible rather than the sandbox refusing; filesystem containment is kept, because a peer's message is a remote input that can make the agent run commands. The network default is applied only where the sandbox is actually `workspace-write`, so tightening the mode does not leave a network grant in the launch. All three are overridable per spawn with `--opt` (including `sandbox_mode=danger-full-access` for no sandbox at all), while an interactive `approval_policy` is refused loud rather than auto-answered on the operator's behalf.

  The guide states the sandbox's guarantee literally: it blocks out-of-workspace local filesystem writes, and does not block reads, exfiltration, or networked side effects. With the network on, a peer-driven turn can read broadly and send what it reads, reach loopback and link-local services, and act through any credential it can read, including irreversibly, via a force-push or an API delete. Containing filesystem writes is not the same as containing damage, and the docs say so rather than implying the residual is disclosure-only. The offline, tighter-mode, and separate-OS-user mitigations are named in both the autonomy section and Limits.

  At-least-once delivery with exact-id acks on turn completion: a failed turn retries with backoff, an interrupt redelivers, and an app-server crash restarts the child in place on the same mesh lifecycle and re-drives the un-acked batch (a crash loop is fatal, never an endless respawn). Presence from the event stream, an opt-in transcript mirror, model catalog + reasoning-effort variants (`cotal models --agent codex`, `--variant`), `--opt` passthrough to codex `-c` config overrides, and a private per-agent `CODEX_HOME` (operator config/hooks/MCP servers never load; auth.json symlinked; trust writes never touch the operator's config). Unwired options fail loud: `--resume` (a resumed codex thread comes up without its configured MCP servers, so the agent would be mute on the mesh) and tool-sharing.

  Also fixes the seed reconciler, which treated a generation match alone as up-to-date: a built-in connector added at an unchanged generation would never seed on an already-installed workstation (`--agent codex` reporting no connector installed). Both fast paths now also require every `SEED_BUILTINS` entry to be present in the ever-seeded set.

  A connector can now declare `launchHint`, the one line a foreground `cotal spawn` prints about what to expect next. That text used to be hard-coded to Claude Code's first-run gate for every agent type, telling operators of other harnesses to press Enter at a prompt that never appears.

  The web dashboard gains Codex branding (the OpenAI mark, from Simple Icons), so a codex agent renders with an icon and a label instead of a blank badge. That map was hand-maintained with nothing tying it to the connector set, so it is now covered by a test: every official connector must have a complete entry, and a new connector cannot ship icon-less with a green suite again.

- 12ad5e3: Close two attach defects: a capability issued for the wrong agent, and remote attach silently dying after a manager repair.

  **An attach capability could be issued for an incarnation nobody authorized.** `opAttach` resolved the
  agent name, awaited authorization — which on a user mesh performs a ledger read, a real async
  boundary — and then asked for a ticket by NAME. Ticket issuance re-resolved that name and bound
  whichever agent held the slot at that moment. A stop and same-name respawn landing inside the await
  therefore authorized one incarnation and handed out a valid terminal capability for its successor,
  which on a user-auth mesh can belong to a different owner. `url()` now requires the authorized handle
  and refuses when the slot has moved under it, and `opAttach` re-asserts the incarnation immediately
  after the await so the non-pty path shares the invariant. This is the same class as the name-binding
  fix in 0.14.4, one step earlier in the sequence: that closed the window at redemption, this closes it
  at issuance.

  **A manager replacement quietly demoted attach to loopback.** The bind host for the manager's
  attach/console face was passed only on the first `cotal up` and never recorded, so every later launch
  for the same mesh fell back to loopback: a same-root repair, adopting a preserved or restored
  listener, and a `spawn -f` manifest deploy. The broker, the agents, and the mesh all stayed up, so the
  only symptom was `cotal attach` failing to connect from another machine. It is not derivable after
  the fact — a broker dial address is deliberately not treated as a manager bind address — so the
  decision is now recorded on the mesh entry and read back by every manager launch. An explicit
  `--host` still wins, and a mesh that never asked for exposure records nothing and stays loopback-only.

  Also narrows `.cotal/manager.log` to 0600 (new and existing), since the manager's console URL is
  written there and that URL carries a credential reaching every agent's terminal.

### Patch Changes

- ed62069: Stop a slow link from deleting a live mesh's registry entry on connect.

  0.14.3 made the registry _sweep_ (`pruneStaleMeshes`) confirm a failure before removing an entry.
  The connect-time path was left with the original behavior, and that is the one that actually bites:
  `preflightTarget` probes with `probeConnect`, whose default budget is one second, and passes no
  override. That probe completes a full auth handshake — TCP, INFO, then the JWT exchange, several
  round trips — which a perfectly healthy broker across a slow or jittery link (a relayed overlay VPN,
  a loaded host) cannot finish in a second.

  The verdict is destructive: a registry-sourced failure deletes the entry and reports "no mesh running
  (stale registry entry - removed)". Both halves of that are wrong when the cause was latency, and for
  a mesh this machine did not start it is unrecoverable, since only `cotal up` writes registry records.
  Observed repeatedly against a reachable remote mesh whose broker was up the whole time.

  A first probe failure now only makes the target a candidate: it is re-probed with a budget that fits
  a real network before anything is classified or removed. A genuinely dead or genuinely
  credential-rejected mesh reaches the same verdict as before, one extra probe later.

### Patch Changes

- fce3199: Report which machine an agent runs on, and fix three defects that only appear once a mesh spans hosts.

  **`meta.host` on the agent card.** A mesh can span machines: a manager on another box launches
  agents into its own host, so "where is this agent actually running" was unanswerable from the
  roster. Each session now publishes its own `os.hostname()` as `meta.host`, overlaid last like
  `meta.connector` so an agent file cannot claim a host it is not on. It is advisory display
  metadata only, never an authorization or routing input, and the dashboard renders it with no
  change (unknown meta keys already display generically). `SPEC.md` records it alongside the other
  reserved `meta` keys.

  **`cotal up --host <addr>` killed the broker it had just started.** The bind address and the
  broker URL were tracked independently, so `--host` bound one address while the readiness probe
  still used the loopback default. The probe found nothing, timed out, and the caller SIGTERM'd a
  broker that had started correctly, which made `--host` alone impossible to use. The two are now
  reconciled: with no explicit `--server`, the URL is derived from the host; a contradicting pair is
  refused with one sentence instead of starting something unreachable; and wildcard binds
  (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) correctly keep a dialable loopback URL rather than advertising the wildcard. The
  manifest path (`broker.host` without `broker.servers`) had the same defect and shares the fix.

  **One slow probe silently unregistered a live mesh.** `pruneStaleMeshes` deleted any registry
  entry that failed a single reachability check whose budget is 1s, which a healthy broker across a
  slow or jittery link misses routinely. Deletion is destructive and, for a mesh this machine did
  not start, unrecoverable, since only `cotal up` writes registry records. A first failure now only
  makes an entry a candidate; it is pruned only if a second, longer probe also fails. A genuinely
  dead mesh still prunes.

  **A timed-out request killed the whole dashboard.** `cotal web` passed an async listener to
  `createServer`, so a rejection inside any route (for example a JetStream call timing out against a
  slow broker) became an unhandled rejection and took the process down on the first slow request.
  The dashboard is a read-only observer: a failing route now returns 500 and the server stays up.

- 02b3243: feat(secret-store): move SpaceAuth (the signing authority) behind the SecretStore seam

  The space trust bundle (`.cotal/auth/auth.json`) is the last and highest-blast-radius durable secret kind. It now flows through the pluggable `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition injects its own KMS/Vault store and no signing seed lands on the hosted disk.

  - New `@cotal-ai/workspace` API: `getSpaceAuth(store, expectedSpace?)`, `putSpaceAuth(store, auth)`, `deleteSpaceAuth(store)`, and `SPACE_AUTH_KEY` (`auth/auth.json`), byte-for-byte the current local path under `workspaceSecretStore`. `getSpaceAuth` validates via the new `@cotal-ai/core` `validateSpaceAuthForRead`, which accepts both a full trust bundle (fully chain-validated) and a stripped signer projection (the `mint --signer`/container form — account keys validated structurally), and never echoes stored seeds/JWTs/space labels in errors. `putSpaceAuth` is the single `sys.signingSeed` strip site.
  - `remintDaemonCreds(root, expectedSpace, store?, { preflight? })` reads the signer through the same resolved store as the daemon cred; `expectedSpace` is required and validated against it. It never overwrites the last-good daemon cred with an unproven one: proof is a broker `preflight` (the manager's live probe, which gates every candidate when supplied) OR authority continuity (the candidate is signed by the same account key as the current broker-accepted cred — what the offline `doctor auth --fix` relies on). A same-label alternate account (full or stripped) is neither, so it is refused rather than clobbering the last-good.
  - The manager reads its signer from the injected `ManagerOptions.secretStore` (`getSpaceAuth(this.secrets, this.space)`); `up`, `mint`, `backup`, `restore`, `doctor`, `spawn`, and the delivery dev-mint helper go through the store. `loadSpaceAuth` remains the sync FS reader for name-only/presence callers and the static-auth single-machine mint composition.
  - `cotal clean all` deletes `auth/auth.json` through the store as its absolute-last step, so a partial-failure reset re-runs against the correct space.

  Closes "no signing seed at rest on a hosted disk"; the remaining hosted gap is signer isolation (the seed is still decrypted in-process at the manager's uid), not custody.

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

### Patch Changes

- c3afdaa: fix(renewal): prove the broker accepted a re-signed daemon credential before reporting it adopted

  `cotal doctor auth` could report a renewal "adopted" that the broker never accepted (a false green). The daemon's credential-reload path now proves acceptance on a disposable preflight connection before it adopts, and the record + `doctor` verdict only ever claim what was proven:

  - The delivery-admin `reloadCreds` reply narrows to `brokerAccepted` (identity/iat/exp actually accepted) plus a best-effort `residentSwap`, never an unwitnessed "adopted".
  - The passive 75% renewal timer and the explicit reload share one single-flight transaction and both preflight before installing a candidate, so a rejected credential in the store can never strand the live connection.
  - The whole daemon-side transaction is deadline-bounded (under the manager's request bound) with a late-commit fence, so a hung store fails loud instead of a silent "no responder".
  - `cotal doctor auth` now exits non-zero and says so when the last renewal was refused by the broker, instead of letting cred-file health alone stand as healthy.
  - The ephemeral generation fingerprint used to bind the expected generation is redacted at the persistence boundary, so it never lands in `.cotal/renewal.json` or logs.

- 2ed747d: feat(secret-store): migrate the membership feed's rw credential onto the store seam with proven standing renewal

  The broker-sourced graph feed's data-account (rw) credential now moves as a full read/write/delete kind through the `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition can renew it end-to-end (KMS/Vault) the way `delivery.creds` already does. Local `cotal up` is byte-for-byte unchanged (the default is the workstation FS store).

  - The feed's rw connection adopts credentials the way the endpoint does: an async source read outside the (synchronous) authenticator, a preflight-proven cache, a 75%-of-lifetime renewal timer, and a single-flight transaction bounded by an absolute deadline. Its authenticator now only ever presents the last **broker-proven** credential, so an incidental reconnect can no longer present an unproven or broker-refused generation and strand the feed.
  - The renewal owner (the manager) and the daemon now share one `SecretStore`: `Manager` takes an optional `secretStore` (defaulting to the workstation FS store) that feeds `remintDaemonCreds` and every per-agent secret kind, and `startMembership` reads the rw credential through the injected store. A hosted composition that hands the manager and the delivery daemon the same store renews both daemon kinds without a restart.
  - `cotal up` writes, and `cotal clean all` deletes, `membership-rw.creds` through the seam (never a raw filesystem write/remove), matching the `delivery.creds` discipline.
  - `credsRenewalDelayMs` (the 75% renew-early convention) is shared from `identity` so the endpoint and the feed compute it identically.

- 9625ec6: Add `cotal update` to reconcile first-party connectors and extensions to one generation, report third-party extensions, and check or opt into a serialized, verified global CLI upgrade.
- 6960658: The web dashboard now ships and versions with the `cotal-ai` binary. Previously `@cotal-ai/web` was fetched separately on its own version line, so upgrading the CLI (`npm i -g cotal-ai@new`) left the dashboard stale, and the documented `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/web` could not cross the 0.x caret to reach the new release, leaving customers on an old dashboard with no clean way forward.

  web is now a bundled first-party extension alongside the connectors: it is carried inside the `cotal-ai` package and the boot reconcile installs and version-refreshes it from that bundled payload at the binary's own version. So `npm i -g cotal-ai@X` brings the dashboard to X automatically and offline on the normal upgrade path, exactly like the connectors (a deliberate operator pin or a rollback is the operator's choice, same as any connector). To make this possible, web is repackaged to be self-contained — its marked/DOMPurify browser builds are copied into its own `dist` and served from there instead of resolving `node_modules` at runtime — so it seeds with no runtime dependencies.

  The bundle path is hardened so the update stays clean and verifiable: the prepack asserts every seeded payload's `name` and `version` match the umbrella (the `fixed` group keeps them lockstep), the reconcile verifies each (re)installed extension is recorded, on disk, and at the generation version before it stamps success (a version-skewed payload fails loud), and web publishes a `vendor-manifest.json` (name/version/license/sha512) of its bundled marked/DOMPurify so the shipped browser libs stay auditable.

### Patch Changes

- 5b2863a: feat: `cotal clean` - one configurable cleanup verb (history / store / all)

  `cotal down` deliberately preserves the on-disk JetStream store, so stale broker state (e.g.
  durables minted by an older, incompatible Cotal generation) survived every down/up cycle and made
  a new-generation `cotal spawn` fail with `consumer already exists`. `cotal clean <history|store|all>
--force` is the operator reset:

  - **history**: purge the retained message backlog on the running broker (channels, plus DMs with
    `--dms`) over the least-privilege purger cred; `cotal history clear` stays as a thin alias.
  - **store**: delete the stopped mesh's JetStream store (`.cotal/nats` or `--store-dir`).
  - **all**: store + the space identity (`.cotal/auth`), every locally persisted cred/marker tied to
    it, crash residue a normal `down` would have swept, and this root's registry entries; the next
    `up` mints a fresh identity.

  Hardening that shipped with it: one shared pidfile probe for `down`/`clean`/`status` (pid > 0
  only; EPERM reads as alive), `down` no longer erases the record of a process it cannot stop nor
  presents a failed stop as clean, registry teardown keys on the canonicalized project root
  everywhere (a named open mesh can no longer delete another mesh's entry), and stale-store failures
  plus `cotal status` now name the reset recipe.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.
