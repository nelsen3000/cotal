# @cotal-ai/core

## 0.69.0

### Patch Changes

- 69232cd: The membership watch callback no longer builds a KV watch entry for every feed message and then discards it. `onChange` takes no argument, so the per-message entry and the replay countdown behind it were never read. `watchMembership` still calls `onChange` once per entry, initial replay included.
- 93716c3: The loopback check that lets plain http carry a credential now has one definition, `isLoopbackLiteral` in `@cotal-ai/core`. `agent-bearer --exchange-url`, the pinned exchange, enrollment redeem, the managed handoff reader and workspace `isLoopbackHost` all call it, so a fix to the rule can no longer reach only some of them. It parses the address, so every IPv6 spelling of `::1` is loopback and a dotted host that is not an IPv4 literal, such as `127.0.0.09`, is not. `isLoopbackHost` keeps only the legacy IPv4 canonicalization a `nats://` host needs.
- 9772fd4: A presence-watch rebind now decides whether the bucket is empty from the typed consumer info the bind already reads. It used to reach the pending count through an optional-chained cast over private nats.js fields, so a client release that renamed one of them would have left the count undefined and skipped the empty-bucket handling without any error: a non-registering observer's view went stale again every liveness window, and a registering observer never re-published its own record.
- adab793: Resolve an agent's read list through one core function, `resolveReadAcl`, at every site: the persona loader, the session config, the manager launch, foreground `cotal spawn` and its user-mode grant, `cotal mint` and the manifest persona merge. An explicit empty `allowSubscribe` now reads `subscribe` everywhere, as an omitted one does. Before, the session refused a persona the loader had accepted. The manager also granted and recorded an empty read list while the provisioner recorded `subscribe`.
- 539266a: `CotalEndpoint` no longer emits an `error` event for a publish denial that the broker already returned to a request. nats.js rejects the request with the denial and also reports the same denial on the connection status, so a call that handled it as its result still produced an `error`, and an endpoint with no `error` listener crashed. An observer's `dmHistory()` returned `[]` and then took down a host with no listener. Refused subscriptions and refused publishes that no request was waiting on are still emitted.
- 0c5b205: `cotal run start`, `resume`, `ps`, `journal` and `answer` now re-describe and re-issue an unpinned manager call that a sibling manager refused before running it, up to the same 16 attempts the CLI's manager commands use. Before, one such refusal ended the command, so in a space with two managers about half of these calls failed with a refusal saying the command was not run. A hosted run's own manager calls now use that bound too instead of 8. The repair is one core helper, `invokeRepairingSplit`, which the CLI and the runtime both call.

## 0.68.0

### Minor Changes

- 6141e7b: The issuing host no longer signs an answering run operator for a checkpoint token a participant manager names. The manager's request now names the run and step it answers (`operator.answers: { runId, stepKey, amend? }`), and the host requires that run admitted on the manager's instance, reads the pause's token off the run's journal under a read it mints for that run, and requires a served answer to name the same run and step as the request it observed. Before, a manager could be issued the answer and settle writes for another instance's waiting pause. The pause lookups `openCheckpointToken`, `settledPauseToken`, `stepPauseToken`, `CheckpointNotOpen` and `CheckpointNotAmendable` move to `@cotal-ai/lang`; `@cotal-ai/runtime` still exports the first four. A participant manager and its issuing host must upgrade together.
- 585fdb2: Connectors launch on the model and variant their launcher resolved. `LaunchOpts.model` and `LaunchOpts.variant` are now the launcher's resolved values (the flag, else the agent file's `model:` / `variant:`), and every connector renders them as given instead of reading the agent file again in `buildLaunch`. Before, a model the launcher did not resolve was taken from a later read of a file that could have changed since, so the seat could run a model the launcher never checked or recorded, and a supervised restart re-read it each time. The in-session config takes the model and variant from `COTAL_MODEL` / `COTAL_VARIANT` only, so the card and the orientation pin no longer report a model the seat was not launched on. The Hermes connector no longer falls back to `HERMES_MODEL` from the spawning process, including one `spawn.env` forwards; set the model with `--model` or the persona's `model:`. Code that calls `buildLaunch` directly must pass `model` and `variant` itself.

### Patch Changes

- 4120c97: `cotal_anycast` no longer answers `Sent to one @<role>.` when no seat may hold the role. It now reports what the sender knows: `Request stored as seq <N> on the @<role> queue (<k> holders online at send; delivery not confirmed).`, with `<role>` spelled as the subject routes it and the count read from the roster a moment before the publish over every seat whose role routes to that queue, never counting the sender, and `holders unknown at send` while the presence view is not current. `CotalEndpoint.anycastAttributed` returns the JetStream publish ack alongside the message, the way `unicastAttributed` does; `anycast` keeps its signature, and `routeToken` is exported so a caller can name the queue a role routes to.
- 218006f: A bearer command that fails without printing a sentence of its own now reports its cause. The agent auth preflight in `cotal spawn` and in the manager, and a running agent's bearer refresh, reported such a failure with Node's `Command failed` line, which repeated the whole bearer argv (exchange URL or state dir, space, owner, actor, token file and health file) and never said whether the child timed out, was killed or exited. The error now says the bearer command timed out after its limit, was killed by a named signal, or exited with a named code and printed nothing. A failure the command explains on stderr is still reported with that sentence. `bearerCommandFailure` in `@cotal-ai/core` builds the error.
- 681c5b0: A supervised Claude seat whose directory the manager host's own Claude does not trust is now refused before it launches, with an error that names the directory and Claude's workspace-trust dialog. Claude opens such a directory on that dialog, whose default answer exits, so the seat used to die on launch with only `EntertoconfirmEsctocancel` as its last output. Trust is read as Claude reads it: a parent directory's trust counts up to the root of the directory's own Git repository, and a linked worktree shares its main checkout's trust. The manager passes the seat's directory to the connector as the new `LaunchOpts.cwd`, so a spawn, a supervised restart and a preserved-seat resume are all checked. A foreground `cotal spawn` still shows the dialog in the operator's terminal. A carried resume uses the same check.
- 0d806ae: A `liveKvEntries` scan whose consumer nats.js rebuilt no longer retries the delete twenty times and swallows every error. The cleanup now waits until the broker has answered every create the rebuilds sent, then sends one delete for each consumer the scan named, newest first, so a successor whose create was still unanswered when the next rebuild fired, or when the scan ended, is no longer left on the broker. A not-found delete counts as gone. A refused delete, from a profile without `CONSUMER.DELETE`, ends cleanup and leaves the consumers to the broker's inactive threshold. A create that got no reply from the broker before a timeout or a closed connection, whose delete then answers not-found, is reported, because it can still land. Any other delete failure is now thrown, for a scan that was rebuilt or not, instead of being swallowed. A cleanup failure never replaces the scan's own error, its cancellation reason or `IncompleteKvScan`.
- 9b439e8: `mintPublicUserJwt` in `@cotal-ai/core` now takes only what it signs with: the space and the account's public key and signing seed. The auth service passed it that partial context behind a cast that turned the type check off for every remote-manager credential it signs. It now passes the context typed. Its authority plane also opens the auth KV view once and reads every manager issuance gate through one helper, where each operation used to reopen the view and rebuild the gate inline. The activate arm's duplicate missing-gate check, which could never run, is gone.
- f018376: A peer's `name/role` roster label used as a target is now refused with the peer's bare name in the message, everywhere a peer is resolved by name: `cotal_dm`, `cotal send dm`, `cotal deliver pending`, the console and `join`'s `/dm`. It used to read as an unknown peer. The label is not resolved as an address because `/` stays reserved for `owner/name` handles.
- 6a1789b: `--share-tools` and a roster `share-tools:` list now accept only servers the cotal config declares. A name inherited by every JavaScript object, such as `toString`, `constructor` or `__proto__`, is refused like any other undeclared name, where it used to launch the agent with that server silently missing. A server the config does declare under the name `__proto__` is shared when selected instead of being dropped.
- 237c813: `cotal_spawn` now returns an uncertain launch as a pending result instead of a tool error. A worker that has not joined the mesh within its readiness window is still managed and may yet join, so the result names the allocated agent, its id and its manager, and says to watch the roster, because spawning again starts a second agent. A launch that exits stays an error. The goal follower keeps the acceptance as the reply data of any terminal other than `succeeded`, and `ControlReply` carries the endpoint error code, so the tool keys on the `uncertain` code rather than on the message. A pinned-model spawn that settles uncertain reports its recorded pin the same way.

## 0.67.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b0da88: Breaking: the issuance-gate types now carry the op rule the gate parsers already enforce. `EpGateRow`, `EndpointGateRow` and `EpGateState` declared `op` optional in every state, so each reader re-derived it with placeholders, assertions and fallbacks for a case the parsers refuse. They are now a union on `state` over a shared `GateOp`: `open` carries no op, and `frozen` and `retired` always carry one. A reader that has checked the state reads `op` directly, and an in-memory gate or barrier that freezes or retires without recording its op no longer compiles. Because they are no longer interfaces, an `interface` that extends one fails with TS2312; declare it as an intersection such as `type CustomGateRow = EpGateRow & { custom: string }` instead. The endpoint gate's mint fence and registration barrier also read the `epgate` row through one shared reader and one mapping into `EpGateState`, so the two `observe` members can no longer refuse a DEL marker or carry the row's fields differently. Gates that parsed before parse the same way, and the refusals are unchanged.
- e65ec69: Breaking: `LifecycleMapping` is now a union on `state` that carries the op rule `parseLifecycleHead` already enforces. It declared `op` optional in every state, so each head reader re-derived the rule with a `<none>` placeholder, an `undefined` in a message or a conditional `opId` for a case the parser refuses. A `retiring` head now always carries its retirement op, and an `active` or `retired` head carries none. A reader that has checked the state reads `op` directly, and an in-memory head that is `retiring` without its op, or `active` or `retired` with one, no longer compiles. Because it is no longer an interface, an `interface` that extends `LifecycleMapping` fails with TS2312; declare it as an intersection such as `type ActiveMapping = LifecycleMapping & { state: "active" }` instead. Heads that parsed before parse the same way, and the refusals are unchanged.
- f389576: `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` carries a Claude session held on the operator's host to a manager on another host, as `docs/design/resume-transfer.md` lays out. The CLI finds the transcript with the connector's new `resumeTranscript` locator and writes it into a JetStream Object Store bucket owned by the target instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, as a chain that an interrupted carry continues. The manager's new operator-only `transcript-receive` command stages it, removes the broker object, and issues a one-time `resumeClaim` that `spawn` consumes; a re-run of the same bytes moves none. The seat forks the transcript in a seat-private Claude home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps --wide` names the source host, session, digest and carry time. The manager cluster document moves to revision 21. Two one-shot credentials carry it on an authenticated mesh: a `transfer-writer` the CLI mints from the space's signing seed for the one transcript it hashed, or on a user-auth mesh exchanges from the operator's login as the new `transfer-writer` view (scope `admin`), and a `transfer-reader` the target manager mints for its own bucket on each receive or sweep, or that the host issues a remote manager through the new manager-service `transferReader` operation. A carried seat records the digest of the transcript Claude forked, and the manager stops a seat whose record does not match the carried bytes, including one whose launch was uncertain and that joined later. Space deletion lists the transfer buckets and deletes them: `deleteSpace` given the space's trust material mints its own `teardown` naming them, and it now throws naming every stream it could not delete instead of reporting success. The console space picker deletes a space this host registered as a static-auth mesh that way. The `transfer-writer` view, and the broker connection minted from it, lives at most five minutes, the static credential's lifetime.

### Patch Changes

- 48f18d0: Remove sentences from shipped comments in core, lang, the CLI and the manager that described what earlier revisions of those comments claimed. The request-path validation note in `endpoint-envelope.ts` now states as current fact that registration-time profile bounds do not replace request-path enforcement, with the `uniqueItems` measurement under it. The barrier-window note in `endpoint-action.ts`, the lang worker header, the worker result backstop, the `--rotate-sys` broker check and the manager's goal-writer epoch belt keep their contract text and drop the history. No behavior changes.
- e85e1fd: An agent's manager calls now repair a class-queue split as the CLI does. In a space with more than one manager, a call can reach a manager other than the one it resolved against, which refuses it before running it. `CotalEndpoint.invokeService` re-described and re-issued that call only once, and the re-issue splits again at the same rate, so with two managers about a quarter of `cotal_spawn` and `cotal_despawn` calls still failed. A spawn whose seat came up was reported as `Couldn't spawn` when the goal-result read that follows it split, and a named despawn was refused with `WAS NOT RUN`. The endpoint now re-issues up to 16 times, the bound the CLI already uses, which core now exports as `BIND_SPLIT_REISSUES`. A named `cotal_despawn` also asks its `inspect` lookup again when the manager that answered names a sibling instance as the owner, until the owner answers, within the same bound; before, it refused a live seat whenever the lookup reached the other manager.
- 79e5268: Every request that carries a manager's `identities` now goes through one parser, `parseRemoteManagerIdentities`, and one name list, `REMOTE_MANAGER_IDENTITY_NAMES`, both exported from core. The run admission and run attempt parsers had their own copy, which checked only that each id was a string. A non-nkey id got through to the proof check and was refused there as `permission-denied`, and a wrong key set got a message that did not name the expected keys. Both now refuse with the same `bad-request` messages as the other manager requests: "identities.<name>.id must be a user nkey" and "identities must contain exactly supervisor, executor, serve, goalWriter, sessionLedger". The auth parsers, the credential checks in authority issuance and the manager's standing renewal checks now use the shared list too, so a change to the identity set happens in one place.
- 954a78b: A `readHistory` page is now sized against the whole reply the delivery daemon sends, including the `ControlReply` around its items. `fitHistoryPage` charges that shell, and the daemon fits the page to the broker's `max_payload` as `maxPayload` reports it. Before, the items alone were fitted to 90% of `max_payload` while that headroom was documented as already covering the reply, so a page that filled the budget produced a reply larger than the budget it was checked against. A page can now use the full `max_payload`, and its reply never exceeds it.
- 562a56b: `@cotal-ai/core` now exports `UserCredentialsRequest`, the one request type `AuthProvider.userCredentials` takes. The reference provider uses it for both the local and the remote client arm: the remote arm takes the request object instead of each coordinate as a positional parameter, and both arms send the `/exchange` body from one builder. A coordinate can no longer reach one arm's exchange body and miss the other's, and two coordinates of the same type can no longer be swapped at the remote call. The exchange body on the wire is unchanged.

## 0.66.1

## 0.66.0

### Minor Changes

- 658c1b8: Breaking: the `ai.cotal.ep.lifecycle-blocked` refusal detail now reports only the state the refusing site read. `headState` is optional and set only where the lifecycle head was read; a new `gateState` (`frozen` or `retired`) is set where the issuance gate was read. A gate frozen by a takeover, a registration or another retirement used to report `headState: "retiring"` over an active head or a service instance with no head, and a retired gate reported `headState: "retired"` with no head. `blockedOp` is the gate's own op kind instead of defaulting to `registration`, and `registerServiceInstance` refuses a frozen gate observed without a valid op (a string `opId` and one of the four op kinds) as `internal`. The manager's reserved-name refusal no longer claims a head state. A client that read `headState` from a gate refusal must read `gateState`.

### Patch Changes

- a07f732: The docs now state the first process epoch. SPEC §13.7 and `docs/embedding.md` say that the first registration of an instance commits epoch 0, that epoch 0 is open and serving like any later epoch, and that each later start of the same instance commits the previous epoch plus one, so a consumer or sweeper never treats 0 as absent or not ready. `docs/embedding.md` also states that `awaitHostFence` takes any non-negative safe integer epoch, 0 included, and refuses any other value with `bad-request`. No behavior changes.
- be53e2d: `parseIssuanceGate` and `parseEndpointGate` now validate a gate's op intent through one shared grammar. Each parser used to carry its own copy of the SPEC 13.1 op rules, and the endpoint copy wrote the op kinds and gate states as inline lists, so a change to the kind set reached only the agent gate and the two families could disagree with nothing failing. Both parsers accept and refuse the same rows as before. The endpoint gate's refusals for a frozen or retired gate without its op, and for an open gate with one, now carry the same explanation as the agent gate's.
- af779f9: Core exports `registerServingInstance`, which runs `registerServiceInstance` and then authorizes the instance's serve grant and writes its `ready` status at the `processEpoch` and `registrationRevision` that registration committed, both fenced on the registration barrier's read of the issuance gate. It returns `{ registrationRevision, processEpoch, grant }`, and an optional `status` adds fields to the ready status. The auth plane's own boot registration, the manager's boot registration and `registerRemoteManagerAuthority` now call it instead of assembling the grant and status by hand, so the epoch these steps run at comes from one place. Their behavior is unchanged.

## 0.65.0

### Patch Changes

- ba5468d: A platform composition that hosts the auth context can now get the host incarnation that a delegated user intent pins as its executor (SPEC 13.16). `PlatformControlInput` takes an optional `host: { endpoint, clusterDigest, artifacts }`: the reverse-DNS endpoint of the host process that runs the intent flights, the closure digest of its §13.7 cluster and every contract artifact that closure needs. The auth plane self-authorizes that one name, and a single-label name is refused at start. With it, `AuthServiceHandle` gains `registerHostIncarnation(instanceId)`, which publishes the artifacts, registers that instance through the same ceremony the auth plane runs for its own `auth` endpoint, and returns `{ instanceId, processEpoch }` with the epoch that registration committed, `observeHostGate(instanceId)`, the sweeper's point-in-time read of that endpoint's issuance gate over the context's own connection, and `awaitHostFence(instanceId, processEpoch)`, which resolves with the gate once it is no longer open at that epoch, or with null once it is absent. A host that registers its persisted instance id at every start fences its predecessor and advances the process epoch, so a restarted host reads its earlier incarnation as gone. A start whose confirming read of the gate finds that a later start of the same instance registered is refused with `conflict`. The returned epoch stays current only until the next start registers, which can happen before the call returns, so the host arms `awaitHostFence` with it before it admits or recovers any flight and stops serving when the hook resolves. `docs/embedding.md` and `docs/design/delegated-user-launch-intent.md` describe all three members. Core's KV issuance gate adapters (`serveIssuanceGateKv`, `provisionEndpointGateOpen`, `endpointRegistrationBarrier` and `readEndpointGateGeneration`) tokenized the endpoint name twice, and the registration repair cursor rebuilt its key from the token, so every reverse-DNS endpoint threw before it reached its gate or partway through its registration. They now carry the name and leave the key builders to tokenize it. Single-label endpoints are unchanged. Core's `registerServiceInstance` also returns the `processEpoch` its completing reopen committed, so a caller no longer reads the epoch back from a gate that a later registration may already have advanced; the auth plane's own registration takes it from there.
- 451ffee: A presence observer now drops a bucket record whose `card.name` or `status` is missing or has the wrong type, or whose `ts` is not a finite number, counts it in `presenceBindingDropCount` and reports it on the `warning` event. Before, a record whose `ts` was missing or text such as `"nope"` stayed live in the observer's roster after its key expired, because the staleness checks compared `NaN` with the liveness window. A record with a non-string `card.name` or a `null` value threw inside the presence watch loop, which ended the watch and surfaced as an `error` event.
- f01aa7c: A manager start now serves at the process epoch its own registration committed. Both the boot registration and `registerRemoteManagerAuthority` read the issuance gate again after `registerServiceInstance` returned and took that read's epoch, so a start that a second start of the same instance superseded in between authorized its serve grant at the successor's epoch, and the remote path returned the successor's epoch and registration revision as its own. `registerServiceInstance` now returns the `processEpoch` its completing reopen committed, both registration paths use it, and the serve grant's epoch check refuses a superseded start with `expired`.
- 2cef9e6: A caller now validates a request's args in the form they are sent, so a key whose value is undefined, which JSON drops, no longer fails a responder's closed input contract. A `cotal spawn --detach` from a current CLI was refused by every manager released before `defaultAgent` existed, even with `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT` unset. A caller-side args refusal is now marked `not-executed`, since nothing was published. Args that JSON cannot carry, such as a BigInt, get the same `bad-request` refusal. A refusal that names a key the responder's contract does not declare carries an `ai.cotal.ep.undeclared-arg` detail. The CLI reads that detail on manager commands and reports version skew with its own version, where it used to print a bare schema error followed by a warning that the request may have run.

## 0.64.0

### Minor Changes

- d121d21: Design record for carrying a detached `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` session to a manager on another host (`docs/design/resume-transfer.md`). The transcript moves through a per-space JetStream Object Store bucket for the target manager instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, with a chunk chain that resumes an interrupted upload and a content-addressed staging copy that makes a repeat move no bytes. The manager gains the operator-only `transcript-receive` command and `spawn` gains a one-time `resumeClaim`. The carried transcript is placed in a seat-private Claude config home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps` and `cotal attach` show where a seat was resumed from. The implementation follows this record in the same change.

### Patch Changes

- 6c79419: A registration refused because another instance holds the endpoint governance slot now carries an `ai.cotal.ep.foreign-slot-held` detail with the holder's instance id and the condition that refused (`no-seam`, `unreadable`, `garbled`, `behind` or `in-flight`). A remote manager reads that detail instead of matching the refusal's message, and asks its host to reconcile the holder only when the holder's gate is still frozen at the slot's stamp. Before, it asked the host for every foreign-slot refusal, so a holder gate that was missing or read below the stamp surfaced the host's "no endpoint gate" or "not frozen" refusal in place of the registration's own, and rewording the core message would have turned the recovery off with no failing check.

## 0.63.0

### Minor Changes

- 22e210a: Start an already-enrolled managed agent in a child outside the manager's filesystem (SPEC §13.17). A runtime may offer `Runtime.spawnDelegated(launch, handoff)`. A manager whose runtime does enrolls through `enrollManagedAgent` once, refuses `--resume`, a manifest agent's `continuity: exact`, `--cwd`, shared MCP servers and non-string launch options before enrolling, never builds a local launch for the seat, and hands the lifecycle off at most once as one closed `cotal-managed-handoff/v1` value carrying the issued owner, actor, host-chosen lifecycle UID, sentinel, pinned exchange base and the raw actor token, which the host never receives. `delegatedSeatCommand` builds the child's `cotal spawn --expect-owner <owner> --expect-lifecycle-uid <uid>` command with `COTAL_MANAGED_HANDOFF_FILE` naming the handoff file. The `cotal` entry takes and deletes that file and drops the variable under any letter case before it parses flags, prints help or loads extensions, including when it refuses an older Node, and refuses spellings that name different files after deleting each of them. The spawn refuses a foreign space, owner, actor or lifecycle UID, an unknown field, a wrong kind and a file that is not a private regular file before any broker connection or exchange request, then runs the enrollment-redeem consumer without redeeming or minting, and exchanges through `agent-bearer --exchange-url` unchanged. No refusal on that path echoes a value from the handoff: the registration's server, exchange and enforcement checks, the local state this machine keeps for the space (its mesh record, user-auth state and agent secret files), target resolution, the policy refresh, the broker preflight, the agent auth preflight and the event-plane policy each refuse with a fixed sentence naming the field and the phase, whether a check fails or a filesystem, exchange or broker error is thrown under it, and an actor that is not a single token or a space that cannot name local state is refused as malformed before any plane. Readiness stays presence-observed, so a lost create acknowledgement settles uncertain and stays held. Every stop of a delegated seat, the reap of a child whose parent exited and a destructive manager shutdown included, runs prepare-retirement, then the handle's fenced close by `managedRuntimeKey`, then the terminal barrier. A preservation cut refuses a delegated seat at prepare time, and a manager stop after a refused cut retires it the same way. A provider resource is bound to that key only by the provider's authenticated answer to its create. The design record, the embedding guide, the CLI and configuration references and SPEC §13.17 describe the shipped shape.
- c975258: A logged-in user can now run hosted workflows on a user-auth space. The auth callout issues an interactive user's `manager-caller` view as an issuance (SPEC 13.15): it chooses the generation, records evidence whose one source is the user's actor-ledger row, and writes the accepted row under a token derived from the connection's inbox nonce, renewing that generation on a reconnect whose ceiling is unchanged. `cotal run` and the other manager calls read the generation back with the new `issuedUserCaller` and ride `ep.v1`, so `cotal run start` against a participant manager started with `cotal supervise` is admitted. The issuing host admits a run from a user caller only for the manager's registered owner, and a participant manager now forwards the served subject of every caller resume and answer, which the host checks against the run's owner and the caller's live issuance; a legacy-rail resume is refused. The issuing host subscribes to those resume and answer request subjects itself and issues for a forwarded one only when it observed that request, only once, and only for the run a resume's envelope names or the endpoint and amendment an answer's envelope names, and never for a request bound to another manager instance or epoch or declaring another class or pinning another contract than the manager registered for that command. Every answering operator issuance must carry that served subject, and an amendment's carries `answers.amend: true`, which the host accepts only for a pause settled with an accepted answer, so `cotal run amend` works on a participant manager. A user caller starts, resumes and answers runs only on the participant manager that user registered, and a static caller keeps its admission there. A managed seat's manager call keeps the legacy rail when the broker refuses its accepted-row read, which surfaces as a request error caused by the permission violation. Revoking or re-granting the actor makes its issuances dead at the next resolution. New exports: `connectionAcceptedToken`, `actorLedgerSource`, `actorLedgerSourceBucket`, `parseActorLedgerSource`, `issuedUserCaller` and `isDerivedOwner` in core, and `ledgerActorSourceIsLive` and `UserCallerIssuer` in auth. `manager-caller` joins the issuable profiles, and the `issuer` profile gains the per-key read of the accepted store. SPEC §13.15 gains a **User-auth issuance** paragraph and §14.8 a **User-auth runs** paragraph, both insertions; `docs/design/user-auth-run-start.md` records the path, and `docs/cli.md`, `docs/workflows.md` and `docs/run-a-mesh.md` describe it. `docs/run-a-mesh.md` also says the stock auth service refuses managed-agent enrollment and retirement preparation for a host platform to intercept.

### Patch Changes

- 62ebc6b: Drop the stream-wide `CONSUMER.DELETE` grants from the observer, admin and agent profiles. An observer could delete another principal's live presence, channel-registry and membership watches and the delivery daemon's `fanout` durable, and an agent could delete a peer's presence and registry watches; those deletes are now refused by the broker. A client's refused delete of its own ephemeral watch, membership snapshot or history consumer, including the predecessor a watch, membership snapshot or history read deletes when it rebuilds after a stall or a delivery gap, is treated as handled and raises no `error` event, and the broker removes that consumer five minutes after its last interest.
- cb6a0bf: A presence record now says when its status was entered. `ts` is the last heartbeat, so an activity that was true when an agent set it stayed on the roster long after it stopped describing anything, and nothing could tell it from a fresh one. Presence gains an optional `statusSince`: the epoch ms when the instance entered its current status and activity. A change to either moves it, while a heartbeat or a repeated report does not, and an offline record carries none. `cotal_roster` prints its age beside the status, such as `idle · unchanged for 40m`.
- 5738154: A restarting manager on an authenticated mesh now verify-evicts its superseded credential family in one shared sweep per 256 holders instead of one holder at a time. The family keeps a ledger row for every credential an earlier incarnation was issued, and every boot adds fresh goal-writer and session-ledger holders, so the re-registration's eviction step grew with each restart: every holder cost a freshly minted credential, a new broker connection and its own delivery-admin request, and the progress cursor was rewritten after each one. After enough restarts the manager stayed off its endpoint rails for minutes while `cotal ps` got no answer from it, and a sweep that outlived the executor window looped on `manager registration executor expired`. Re-registration now sends the pending holders through the `evictPrincipals` verb that `cotal reconcile-gate` and the boot self-heal already use, records the verified ones after each request before it sends the next, and still leaves the gate frozen when any holder is not verified gone. `cotal reconcile-gate` and the boot self-heal now also record each request's verified holders before the next, so a family past 256 holders keeps the requests that already succeeded when a later one is refused or the executor window closes. The registration barrier's `evict` seam in `@cotal-ai/core` now takes the holder set and answers one verdict per holder, and the barrier's `evictMax` caps how many holders one call carries. A remote manager's host still evicts one principal per maintenance call, so its barrier sets `evictMax` to 1 and a refused host call keeps every holder the host verified before it. The 60-second wait for a delivery daemon that is still binding applies to each of those requests, and each request mints its own short-lived credential so the wait never outlives it.
- 101c9b0: Presence now carries `activitySince`, the epoch ms when the current activity was set. A status change or a heartbeat does not move it, so an activity left behind while hooks flip the status every turn no longer reads as fresh beside a `statusSince` that moved on the last flip. `cotal_roster` prints its age after the activity, such as `(set 9h ago)`, and dates only a finite stamp, so a record holding `null`, a string or an exponent literal such as `1e400` renders no age.
- 9d5cc09: First-run `cotal setup` now shares your own Claude Code MCP servers with the sessions Cotal spawns. It copies the user-scope servers from your Claude Code config into the cotal config's `connectors.claude.mcpServers` and names them in its output, so a spawned session has the tools you know plus the cotal tools. Before this, a spawned session loaded only the cotal server and setup never said why. With none to copy it writes an empty list, and a cotal config that already declares that list keeps it. A server with an `env` or `headers` value that is anything but `${VAR}` references is left out and named, because the cotal config keeps secrets only as `${VAR}` references. So is an entry no session can start, such as one with a missing or empty `command` or `url`, or one whose `command` is not a string. For a lighter seat, remove entries from the cotal config or spawn with `--share-tools none`. Connector setup providers gain an optional `mcpServers` action whose `seed` input the CLI binds to workspace's new `seedConnectorServers`, which writes under a lock so two setups run at once record one list. Core exports `readCotalConfigFile` and the `ConnectorShareSetupInput` type, and connector-core exports the `ENV_REFERENCE` pattern it already used.

## 0.62.0

### Minor Changes

- bcf66d6: Add a delegated user intent: SPEC §13.16, a design record, and the host decisions it needs. A signed-in user admits one launch or one retirement on the host's authenticated route, and a platform control holder consumes that intent once from its current registration, epoch, assignment revision and lifecycle. `@cotal-ai/core` adds the closed request types and parsers for the user's intent and the holder's execution, `parseRemoteDelegatedUserIntentExecutionResult`, and `resolveReadAcl`, the read-list resolution `provisionAgentDurables` already used. `@cotal-ai/auth` adds `authorizeDelegatedUserIntentAdmission` and `authorizeDelegatedUserIntentExecution`, the record, pin and flight types, `delegatedUserIntentHoldsAlias` and `joinOrStartDelegatedUserIntent`, `AuthServiceHandle.observeManagerGate`, which a platform composition's handle carries so the host reads the holder's gate over the context's own connection, and `AuthServiceHandle.activateManagedLifecycle`, which activates a delegated launch's lifecycle at its pinned UID before any row or durable and mints nothing, so a launch the host compensates or the user retires reaches the terminal barrier even when its agent never exchanged. Admission derives nothing from the request: it takes the owner the host derived from the verified IdP subject, requires `spawn` on the user's own fresh ledger row, binds the account's current platform assignment and the holder's open gate, and dry-runs the envelope walk from the user's principal over the read list the writer will provision. Execution compares the request with the record and with the fresh assignment, gate epoch and registration proof, and returns the user's owner and parent for the host's writers. The holder gains no grant, no decision reads `supervise`, and the `platform-control` view's same-owner rule is unchanged. Stock dispatch refuses both kinds as `unimplemented`; a host that owns an intent store and the enrollment and retirement writers composes the decisions on its own routes. `@cotal-ai/manager` adds `remoteAuthority.executeDelegatedUserIntent`, `StartAgentOpts.delegatedIntent` and `Manager.retireDelegatedAgent`: a delegated launch takes the hosted enrollment arm with the intent's execution and refuses material under any owner but the intent's, and `retireDelegatedAgent` stops a delegated agent only after the host confirms `retired: true` for its exact target and operation id. A delegated agent's name, including one whose launch failed at any step after the host's enrollment answer, stays held until then.

### Patch Changes

- 97a2382: The cotal config accepts a `modelPolicy` that names, per role, the models (and optionally the variants) a seat in that role may launch on. The manager refuses a detached spawn, and `cotal spawn` refuses a foreground one, before anything is minted when the effective role has an entry and the effective model is missing or not on its list, or its variant is missing or off a declared variants list, or the launch carries launch options (from `launchOptions:` or `--opt`), which the connector applies unread after the model and which can select another model. Ids compare whole, so `vendor/model-B-fast` does not satisfy `vendor/model-B`. The refusal names the persona, whether the value came from its own `model:` or `variant:` field or from `--model` or `--variant`, the value found, and the values allowed. Roles without an entry are unconstrained, a space-local entry replaces the operator-level entry for the same role, and a malformed policy (including an unsupported field of any name) fails the spawn loudly. Before this, a persona pinned to a superseded model, or to none, launched on it with no report.
- 9236a12: Recover an ordinary resume whose coordinator and manager were both lost after the retained agents launched. The coordinator journals `resume-active` only after the manager's launch returns, so a crash in between left `resume-intent` behind a live agent, and the replacement manager refused it as `already live and this runtime cannot authoritatively adopt it`, leaving the journal degraded and the agent owned by nobody. On a static mesh the replacement manager now reads the seat reference the lost manager recorded on that agent's slot, reaps the seat through its runtime, waits for the principal to leave presence, and launches it again. A live principal with no such record, or one that stays live after the reap, is still refused. Tmux handles now carry a reference bound to the tmux server, window and pane, and the tmux runtime can reap by it, so a successor manager also closes the window of a tmux seat it retires instead of leaving it running. The reap closes that window even when the agent's pane already exited, since `remain-on-exit` or a second pane keeps the window open. It refuses a pane that has moved out of that window, whether it still runs or has exited, and a window that has moved out of the session, including one that moves while the reap runs.

## 0.61.0

## 0.60.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ca4d8e: Add the platform control authority: a closed `platform-control` view, beside the unchanged human `manager-service` view, that lets a host platform run one pooled control manager per assigned account without a human session (SPEC §13.1, §13.6, §13.9). `startAuthService` takes an optional `platformControl: { observeAssignment }` input, and the returned handle then carries `platformControlAuthority`, a typed in-process door served on no listener. It issues the existing manager-service request family under a host-derived `p_` platform owner (`platformControlOwner`), reads the backend's assignment fresh on every call, reuses the registration proof, process epoch and all-duty renewal unchanged, confines maintenance to the assigned instance, and refuses `prepare` and `activate` while a named predecessor manager is still registered. It refuses IdP tokens, another account, a stale assignment, another owner's instance, unknown fields (a nested `session` field included) and the managed-agent kinds. `@cotal-ai/core` adds the `PlatformControlAuthorityRequest`, `PlatformControlInnerRequest`, `PlatformControlAuthorityResult` and `PlatformControlAssignment` types, the `p_` owner grammar, and an opt-in `allowPlatform` on the principal owner checks and on CONNZ attribution (`principalFromConnz`). Only the platform family's own boundaries opt in: the issuance gate row, the credential holder row, the eviction and liveness sweeps with the delivery daemon's executors, the manager goal-index scanner, the run driver caller, and, for the platform holder only, the retirement target, retained-validation target and admin caller parsers. The membership feed and the message drop guards still refuse a `p_` owner. Presence has no owner check, so a platform endpoint's roster card appears under its `p_` owner. `startAuthService` also forwards a trusted-host `standingRenewableTtlSeconds` to the authority plane. The human remote-supervision path is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 3b616a2: A manifest agent can declare `continuity: exact` to come back in its previous harness session. The manager records the session the connector proves over its authenticated control endpoint on the first launch, keeps that record current through crash recovery, preserved resume and stop, reopens it on every later launch and preserved resume under the same proof, and refuses one recorded for another space, connector or directory. A reopen fails when the harness no longer has the session rather than starting an empty one under the same id: connectors declare the new `supportsSessionReopen` capability and honor `LaunchOpts.reopenSession`, and Pi reopens with `--session`. Preflight refuses `exact` on a connector that cannot reopen an existing session.

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- c389563: Hosted runtime create and status for managed agents. Core adds the closed `manager-managed-agent-runtime-create` and `manager-managed-agent-runtime-status` kinds on the manager-service-authority transport, with parsers that refuse any unknown top-level or target field, including `providerRef`, `handle`, and `name`. Core also adds a result builder and binder whose `state`, `readiness`, and optional `retirementPhase` come from closed sets. The auth service adds `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentRuntimeCreate` and `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentRuntimeStatus`. Each applies the enrollment door's gate, epoch, and proof checks, reads `supervise` from the manager actor's own ledger row, and returns only `{ owner, instanceId, actor, target }`. The loopback verify-enrollment door serves both kinds, and stock dispatch refuses them with `unimplemented`. The manager client adds `remoteManagedAgentRuntimeRequest` and `remoteManagedAgentRuntimeState`. The enrollment result gains an optional, display-only `runtimeIntent: { state: "reserved" }`, which older hosts omit and the manager never treats as authority.
- fb1bc26: Let a credentialed peer ask which plane is broken, instead of guessing at its own credentials

  The subjects that answer "is the manager alive" are owner-only, so a peer holding perfectly valid
  credentials could not ask. When its join or its send failed, that peer could not tell a credential
  problem from a dead manager, an unbound delivery daemon, or a broker that was entirely healthy, so
  every failure presented as a credential failure, because that was the only hypothesis it was able to
  form. A reporter running a 30-agent deployment for a week recorded six independent surfaces that each
  reported success over a failure, including a `pgrep` that matched its own command line and therefore
  failed in both directions. In every case diagnosis cost hours rather than minutes, and in every case
  the missing piece was the same: nothing could be asked whether it was alive by anyone who did not own
  it.

  A read-only liveness surface now answers that question. A peer sends a presence probe on
  `live.<plane>.<owner>.<actor>` and learns whether the manager and the delivery daemon have bound
  responders for the space. It is shaped like the Synadia micro protocol's `$SRV.INFO`, a well-known,
  read-only, presence-only request/reply probe, but it rides a Cotal subject inside the space rather
  than the literal `$SRV` tree, which sits outside per-space account isolation and outside every grant
  builder and subject audit the system already enforces.

  Presence is the whole answer. The reply carries the plane, one responder verdict and an opaque
  per-bind responder token (below), and nothing else: no holder, no pid, no workspace root, no
  runtime, no roster, and no instance id, since the token is minted from nothing and names no
  instance. That is why the probe is a
  request rather than a lease read: the manager's lease row carries the operator's filesystem path and
  a process id, so the responder reduces it to a single enum and the row never crosses the wire. A peer
  gains no read of either lease bucket, cannot probe under another principal's identity, and cannot
  subscribe the responder's serve filter to answer for a plane it does not own.

  Unknown stays first class, reusing the classifier `cotal status` already grades by. Only the broker's
  own no-responders answer becomes "unbound"; a timeout, a permission refusal or an unreadable reply
  all become "unknown", because each is a failure to find out, and reporting a failure to find out as
  health is the defect this surface exists to remove. A responder that cannot determine its own state
  says so rather than guessing, and a reply is never counted as health merely for having arrived.

  The reply also names which responder answered it, as an opaque per-bind token and not an identity.
  Manager instances coexist per instance id, each responder answers only about itself, and the queue
  group hands one probe to one arbitrary member, so two instances holding opposite verdicts made
  identical probes alternate with nothing in the answer to say a second instance existed. With the
  token a caller that probes more than once can tell two responders apart from one responder that
  changed state. One probe still samples one responder and cannot report a split by itself.

  SPEC §6.1 defines the `live` subjects, the `LivenessAnswer` reply and its grading, and the
  message-flow docs page describes them.

  A remote manager can now answer the probe it already binds. It runs the same start path as a local
  supervisor, so it binds the manager plane's responder, and its credential carried neither the serve
  subscription nor the bounded reply row. The subscription was denied and a peer asking about the
  manager plane received the broker's own no-responders answer, which grades "unbound": a definite
  verdict about a plane that was in fact bound, produced by a gap in a credential. Both rows are now
  on that profile, pinned to the supervisor actor that does the serving.

  The responder's rejection notice for a reply target outside the sender's own subtree now travels on
  the endpoint's non-fatal warning channel. It was emitted on the `error` channel, and Node's
  `EventEmitter` rethrows an `error` emitted with no listener attached, so an embedder that had not
  attached one ended its process when a peer sent a probe naming such a target. The plane was then
  genuinely unbound and the next probe reported it as such, so the notice manufactured the state it
  described. The guard's behaviour is unchanged: the frame is dropped and the responder keeps serving.

- 499bd8a: Breaking: a flag given more than once is now a usage error unless the command declares it repeatable (`multiple`), as `FlagSpec.multiple` already documented. `parseCommandArgs` used to keep the last value with no error, so `cotal down web --space a --space b` acted on `b`, and a wrapper that checked the first value verified a different target than the command used. The CLI now prints `Option '--space' cannot be repeated` with the command's help and exits 1 before the command runs. `-f` and `--file` count as the same flag, and a word after `--` stays a positional. Repeatable flags such as `--opt` and `down --session-store` still collect every value. A script that repeats a flag to override an earlier value must pass it once.

### Patch Changes

- 5bec8b2: `cotal attach` now opens a seat's session on a user-auth mesh. The CLI presents its bearer identity together with the session grant to the auth service's exchange, which issues a `session-caller` view bearer only after it confirms, against the redeemed `session.<id>` row and the serving manager gate, that this owner and actor hold that session. The callout re-checks the same row and mints the same `session-caller` rails with the grant's expiry that the static path mints. No local seed is read or written.
- 6c01470: `cotal backup create` no longer refuses a cut because the presence bucket is missing. The bucket is memory-backed, so it does not survive the broker stop that makes the cut. Backup now accepts that stream as absent from the stopped store and still requires every other stream exactly. Restore still requires presence after it recreates the space's infrastructure.
- cfc3b95: `cotal status` now has one Machine row per installed connector instead of fixed `Claude` and `OpenCode` rows. Each row reports whether the executables that connector declares in `requires` are on PATH, so a machine running Codex, jcode, pi or Hermes sees its harness. The `Claude plugin` and `Claude skills` rows now come from the Claude Code connector: a setup provider may declare a read-only `status`, and `cotal status` and the setup card print the rows it returns. A machine without the Claude connector no longer shows them. The extensions manifest caches each connector's setup ref, so status imports only connectors that declare a provider, and the seed reconcile refreshes a seeded entry whose cache predates it instead of checking the Claude connector by name. The debug handoff that `cotal setup` offers when a step fails now comes from connectors: a setup provider may declare an `assist`, and the menu offers one `Debug it with <harness>` option for each present connector that declares one. The Claude Code connector declares the existing Claude handoff. When no connector can host a handoff, the menu says so instead of silently omitting the option.
- 350c87b: The delivery daemon no longer exits when a credential adoption arrives while it is still starting. Its lease turns ready before the membership feed, the timer writer and the lease watch are up, so a manager's boot-time `reloadCreds` could land in that window and reconnect the daemon's connection under the lease watch it was still creating, which then timed out and stopped the daemon. Until start-up finishes, `reloadCreds` is now refused with nothing adopted, and the renewal owner records that refusal. The next renewal pass or the daemon's own 75% re-read adopts the re-signed credentials.
- 608f5f4: Re-attach doc comments that had drifted away from the declarations they document. A `/** */` block followed directly by another one documented nothing, so editor hovers and the published type declarations showed no doc for the intended declaration (for example `Manager`, the `plane3` field and `AclResolver`). Each such block now sits above its declaration, is merged into the block it duplicated, or is removed when its declaration no longer exists. A new `pnpm check:doc-comments` check, run as part of `check:docsbundle`, refuses a doc block followed directly by another in shipped source.
- 43c4179: Focus mode no longer loses or repeats channel messages whose id is empty. Focus recall found messages again by their wire id, so one id-less message on a quiet or muted channel hid every id-less focus message and mention from `cotal_inbox`, and an id-less recall item was handed over again on every call. A live delivery carries no stream sequence, so recall cannot match an id-less stream copy to the delivery it came from. In focus, an id-less channel message is now held in the inbox as pull-only and `cotal_inbox` hands it over once; a mention still wakes the agent. Each id-less copy the session settles records the chat stream's last sequence read after it arrived, and recall binds it to one stream copy at or below that sequence, by the stream sequence `Endpoint.recallChannel` now returns alongside each message. Identical copies arrive in stream order, so recall binds them in that order, latest first, each to the latest unbound stream copy at or below the lowest sequence read for it or any later identical copy, and reads that answer out of order cannot swap two copies. A copy that arrives while a read runs binds nothing in that read; recall reads the channel again, up to three times, and if the copy could still be a stream copy in the last read, it leaves that stream copy in the stream and reports the channel as incomplete. Inbox overflow frees only the evicted copy, held or quiet, and a copy no read has bound yet keeps its place in arrival order, so an identical muted copy is never handed back in its place. Recall hands back into the inbox only the stream copies nothing is bound to, so one sent during a reconnect gap or evicted on inbox overflow is still delivered once; a settled copy behind the focus start or out of retention never hides a later identical copy. A copy's sequence read bounds it only if it answers before the connection drops; otherwise recall reports the channel as incomplete. Every identical copy takes its own disposition, so a new identical quiet mention is still delivered automatically, and a late copy of one recall handed back can surface a second time. A full inbox leaves them in the stream and the reply reports the channel as incomplete. `Endpoint.recallChannel` also reports `unanswered` when no history read answered (replay off, or a failed read); recall then settles nothing for that channel and reports it as incomplete, recall calls run one at a time, and bookkeeping for copies that aged out is deleted. `cotal_inbox` also tracks held and oversized items by receive key, so the held note counts every id-less item it did not carry.
- 4a12111: The hosted `cotal run ps` now reads each run's revocation marker, as `run ps --local` already did. A revoked run whose driver died is listed as `revoked` with the revoker and reason instead of `running`, and a marker the manager cannot read prints `unchecked` and exits 1. The `run-ps` rows gain optional `revoked` and `revocationUnreadable` fields; the record's own `state` is unchanged.
- 569cb6f: The Jcode connector checks a resumed session's counts by how they are spelled, the way Jcode reads a u64: a count written with a fraction or an exponent (`1e20`, `1.0`) or as `-0` is refused before the seat launches instead of being forked as a number Jcode cannot load, and every other number is copied into the fork byte for byte. A source whose title is longer than the 1024 characters the manager records with the fork is refused before launch by name, rather than forking and leaving the seat's provenance off its resume document.
- b4c69bf: A seat whose turn died on a harness-reported error now shows it on every operator surface. A Jcode seat relays the Harness error code, such as a provider `rate_limit`, as its presence `condition`, both for a turn the host drives and for one the TUI owns. `cotal ps` now carries that condition: the human row reads `waiting (rate_limit)` and `--json` rows include the `condition` object, alongside the roster, `cotal status` and `cotal endpoints`. The next turn clears the condition when it starts. Before, the seat read a bare `waiting` and the error was recorded only in its private connector log.

  Presence gains an optional `activeAt`: the epoch ms of the last work event the harness reported, carried on the next heartbeat. A Jcode seat records every token and tool event of its session there. `cotal ps`, `cotal status`, `cotal endpoints` and `cotal_roster` now print a condition with its age and the age of the last work event, such as `waiting (rate_limit for 40m) · active 40m ago`, and `cotal ps --json` rows carry `activeAt`. A turn that stopped advancing while its process keeps heartbeating no longer reads like one that is still working.

- f485c49: A run driver now advances the run record's `journalHigh` after every journal append, before the program acts on the entry. A tail delete of records appended since the last activation used to leave a short journal that a successor resumed from, performing those effects again. The successor now refuses it with `RunJournalTailTruncated`.
- 5f13124: Private launch files now have an owner. The Claude persona file, the Claude shared-server MCP config file and the pi persona file are listed on the new `LaunchSpec.artifacts`, and the launcher removes them once it has proved the agent process gone. On the default pty runtime the manager removes them when it sees the agent exit; on tmux, cmux, orca and herdr the manager removes them by polling the seat's status and waiting for the runtime's exit proof; the foreground `cotal spawn` removes them when its child exits. Every one of those launches also starts its child through the new core `reclaimWithChild`: a watcher started beside the child removes the files once the child's process is gone, and tries a failed removal again every five seconds until it succeeds, so a killed manager or foreground `cotal spawn` no longer strands them (POSIX; Windows has no shell for the watcher). Each directory name carries a random per-launch identity, so a stale path can never name a later launch's directory. The tmux, cmux, orca and herdr runtimes now throw the new core `SpawnRefused` for an unsafe name, an unreachable backend, (herdr) a missing working directory or an unknown layout, (orca) a working directory that is missing or outside any Orca worktree, and a launcher script they cannot write or (tmux, herdr) a session or server that will not start, all before the agent's command is handed to the backend, and the manager removes the files at once. A removal that fails, after an exit or after a refusal, is tried again until it succeeds. A batch resume removes the files of specs it built and never launched. Both connectors now refuse a bad model, prompt or launch option before writing anything. Any other spawn that throws is not proof that nothing started, so its files stay for the child's watcher, or for the OS temp reaper when no child started, as do a killed launcher's on Windows. A seat started under a custodian with `launchSeat` from `@cotal-ai/seat`, which the manager no longer does for a new launch, hands them to that custodian: a launch it refuses before any process started removes them at once, the custodian removes them when it sees the agent exit, a removal that fails stays on the custody record, and a reap that proves the seat gone removes what the record still lists from the temp dir the launch wrote to, so a successor with a different `TMPDIR` still removes them. Losing a custodian's connection no longer counts as the agent's exit. The docs now say that owner-private means any process running as the same user can read the file while it exists.
- fb1bc26: Keep the liveness responders bound across reconnects

  A liveness responder was bound once, on the connection that was current when it started. A full
  endpoint reconnect closed that connection and the responder with it. The remote manager runs one
  after every credential renewal. A peer probing the plane then got the broker's no-responders answer
  and was told `unbound` while the manager or the delivery daemon was connected and serving. The
  endpoint now keeps each responder as intent and binds it again on every connection it opens, under
  a new responder token.

  The manager's responder also answered `bound` after its service connection closed, for as long as
  it waited to re-dial, because it only checked that it still held a serve handle. It now answers
  `unbound` until the re-dial has bound the service again.

- eb2681e: Discard non-object message payloads before reading envelope fields so malformed JSON values cannot stop live delivery, durable consumers or retained-message reads.
- 446ed23: The Plane-3 trusted reader now removes a durable inbox entry addressed to a retired lifecycle the first time it meets one. Retirement purges the lifecycle's read-ACL row and leaves a tombstone, so the reader drops the entry and deletes it from the inbox stream at once, without ten redeliveries and a give-up line. Before this, every such entry was given up and kept, so any reader that started from a fresh cursor swept the whole backlog again. An entry whose ACL row is simply missing is still retried, given up and kept, because a missing row does not prove the owner is gone. The reader acks a retired entry only after its delete succeeds, so a failed delete is retried, up to the same ten redeliveries, instead of leaving the entry stored with nothing left to remove it. An entry the stream no longer holds counts as removed. A daemon that stops serving while that delete is in flight leaves the entry pending for the daemon that serves next, instead of giving it up. The `delivery` credential gains `STREAM.MSG.DELETE` on the inbox stream for this.
- 15c16ff: Create the presence KV bucket in memory storage, at `cotal up`, at restore and when an open-mode endpoint creates it. A file-backed presence bucket could latch a broker write error that refused every later presence write, and so every new join, until the broker restarted. A bucket created file-backed by an older version keeps file storage until its stream is recreated. `cotal up` now warns about a broker below nats-server 2.14.5 only when the space's presence bucket is still file-backed.
- 8ce6be3: The 0.33.0 changelog entry "An agent now reads only the channels it lists" now carries a correction. It presented the read-set default-deny as new in 0.33.0, but that shipped in 0.28.0 with #821, so upgrading from 0.28.0 or later needs no migration for it. The correction names what 0.33.0 did change: the no-default-channel check in `multicast` now refuses only an omitted channel, so an explicit empty-string `channel` is no longer refused as if it were omitted, and its refusal is reworded; the `cotal_send`, `cotal_leave` and pi tool text; doc comments; and two regression suites. `docs/release.md` now describes how to correct a released entry.
- 08194ec: `cotal reconcile-gate` now names the delivery lease blocker when the delivery daemon gives no liveness verdict. A `liveness-unestablishable` refusal used to advise starting the daemon with `cotal up` whatever the cause. It now reads `lease.0` and reports whether the lease is absent, unreadable, held by a daemon that is not ready, held by a ready daemon while the query went unanswered, or taken by another daemon while the query was outstanding, with the holder, the account, when the holder acquired the shard and when the row was last written. It reads the lease before the query and again after it fails, and names a holder as the blocker only when the same daemon run held the lease both times. For a ready holder it advises re-running before stopping anything, since the rail is queue-grouped and a stopped daemon still subscribed to it can take the query. It advises starting a daemon only when no lease exists. A row whose times are not valid dates reads as unreadable instead of failing the command. An explicit daemon refusal keeps its own reason and adds the same lease line. The manager's boot self-heal uses the same probe and reports the same line. The refusal, exit code 2 and the frozen gate are unchanged.

  The delivery lease row now carries `acquiredAt`, set when a daemon's acquisition of the shard succeeds and kept on every ready flip and renewal, while `since` still records the latest write. Rows from older daemons have no `acquiredAt`. `docs/cli.md` lists the lease readings.

- aa12a1a: Gate reconciliation no longer scales with credential family size. `cotal reconcile-gate`, manager boot self-heal and remote manager maintenance revoke the family's ledger rows 16 at a time, then verify-evict every distinct holder in one shared scan, KICK and verify sweep through the new `evictPrincipals` delivery-admin verb instead of one connection and one sweep per holder. The sweep keeps up to 16 KICK requests in flight, so a family whose holders are still connected no longer pays one broker round trip per connection. Holders a sweep verifies are still recorded durably when another holder is not verified, and an interrupted sweep records none.
- d90f9f2: An endpoint now reports its first failed Plane-3 leave after the broker refuses a durable channel's live subscription on `warning` instead of `error`. The endpoint keeps retrying that leave until it succeeds, but the `error` notice killed a host with no `error` listener before the second attempt ran. A host that survived the rejection lost the retry, so the channel stayed `durable-unclosed`. This matches the boot self-join retry, which already reports on `warning`.
- 569cb6f: A `--resume` seat's fork provenance is recorded on the manager. `LaunchSpec` gains `resumeRecordPath`, where a connector whose seat forks after launch has it record the source session id, the source title and a SHA-256 of the transcript it read; the Hermes and Jcode connectors declare it. The manager reads that record once the seat has written it, keeps it on the seat's resume document (an optional `resumed` field, so earlier documents still resume), and adds a `resume` object to the `ps`/`inspect` row (manager cluster revision 20). `cotal ps --wide` prints `forked from <id>` with the title and hash, and the Hermes and Jcode seats print the same facts when they fork. The Jcode fork now carries a count above 2^53 byte for byte instead of rounding it, refuses a count outside the u64 range by name, and refuses a fork record that is not an object by name.
- d0b1da3: Record a changed answer on a settled run step. `cotal run amend <runId> <stepKey>` files a new answer beside a settled checkpoint's or ask's accepted one, naming the answer it supersedes, and `cotal run journal` lists each amendment under the step in the order the store committed them, so the last one is the current position. Each filing is its own record, so returning to an earlier position is listed too. A settled `ask` now prints the answer it accepted, as a checkpoint does, read from its answer record even when the value is a record with fields named like a checkpoint's result. The pause stays settled and the run keeps the answer it acted on; a second `answer` is still refused. The hosted path is the `amend` form of the manager's `run-answer` command (cluster revision 19), and a spawned seat may amend only an answer recorded under its own name.
- 37075a2: `cotal run ps` and `cotal run journal` take `--json`, hosted or `--local`: one JSON object per row per line on stdout, with the run header and errors on stderr, as `cotal ps --json` does for seats. A run row adds its pinned `startedAt` and the `programHash` of its recorded program. A step row adds its effect kind and name, the recorded status and error code, its start and end times, and for an open pause its deadline and the `onExpiry` a checkpoint was armed with, which a checkpoint now records on its pending entry. An unreadable revocation marker under `--json` prints its reason to stderr and exits 1. `run ps --local` now reads its rows through the same listing the manager answers `run-ps` with, so both paths print the same rows.
- 8d8d69a: A pty seat whose process exits on its own is logged as `seat reaped: ... exit code <n>[, signal <s>]` followed by the last line the child printed that starts with a connector's `[cotal-<name>]` or `[cotal-<name>/<part>]` prefix, cut to 240 characters, such as `[cotal-jcode] AG-UI emitter stopped: ...` or `[cotal-hermes/bridge] ...`. This holds for a seat the manager spawned in-process and for one a seat custodian holds. The custodian now sends the child's exit code, signal and that diagnostic with its exit event, and the seat handle reports them through `exitInfo()`, so a custodial seat no longer reads `exit detail unavailable from runtime "pty"`. `@cotal-ai/seat` exports the shared `ConnectorDiagnosticReader`. The custodian writes the same record beside the custody record, so a reap of the seat by reference reports how the child ended. When that record cannot be written, the custodian logs why, and the reap of a child that ended on its own says the record is missing or unreadable.
- c7bfc2d: The standing-renewal smoke's expired-credential cell now goes red on every run when the endpoint's expiry guard is removed, and its mutation fixture grades that cell again. The broker still admits a JWT during the second its `exp` names, so a rebuild that dialed inside that second presented the expired credential without a denial and the cell stayed green. The suite now holds its failed renewal read until that second has passed, and the cell counts only the broker's CONNECT denial, no longer the expiry line of a connection that had already authenticated. Endpoint behaviour is unchanged.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- 95ae645: The auth retirement rail is a conforming registered endpoint with a describable contract. The requester calls it through the generic client in the exact target mode. A legacy body is refused as unsupported-version.

### Patch Changes

- 0589316: Allow an endpoint to configure native NATS heartbeat timing on its resident connection without changing other clients' defaults.
- 59a7e64: Expose an account-scoped delivery service handle with explicit store identity and per-context close while retaining the CLI daemon runner. Close membership connections after disconnected drains so stopped contexts cannot reconnect when the broker returns. Keep health failures during asynchronous delivery startup local to that context and close resources returned after a failed start.
- 2457692: The broker floor SPEC §13.12 states is now enforced on every endpoint connection, the provisioning connections and `cotal up`, and `cotal up` names a broker below 2.14.5 as one whose presence bucket can latch.
- 7c54825: Distinguish native consumer deletion acknowledgments and observed disappearance from uniquely attributable removals. Refuse live KV CAS successors, preserve exact-target INFO grants, and propagate unknown uniqueness through Manager reconciliation. Count ACL and membership rows removed by a competing purge as observed disappearances, not prior absence or this caller's deletion.
- 2c31f95: Clean up each finite KV scan's owned consumer on completion, interruption or cancellation, while retaining the broker's inactivity expiry as a crash backstop. Preserve cancellation through empty-scan bind and cleanup, including calls with an omitted filter, instead of returning an empty result. Membership-feed reconciliation now reads live entries in one scan.
- 397bc60: Deprovisioning returns truthful bounded resource accounting distinguishing deleted resources from absent no-ops across repeated teardown attempts. Key existence and tombstone state are verified through exact Direct Get checks before purging KV keys, ensuring repeated deprovisioning reports zero deleted entries. Partial broker failures record refused resources and raise DeprovisionError with partial accounting rather than discarding earlier progress.
- 7b3924c: Retire a lifecycle's durable membership rows through target-pinned exact-key grants. Complete inventory derives channels from validated native keys, including wildcard-covered and unnamed channels, so unreadable values cannot hide rows from cleanup. An unavailable inventory retains undiscovered rows and holds retirement pending retry. Other principals and successor lifecycles remain untouched. Retirement fixtures now use complete zero-row responses only for empty synthetic inventories, and the user-mode test verifies held retirement until genuine delivery returns.
- 1721738: Support signerless manager run hosting through typed host admission, initial-attempt and renewal operations. Renew the complete standing credential family while preserving held identities, serve epochs and last-good credentials on refusal. Keep pooled managers off local PTY launch paths and enforce the execution host boundary. Update the native lifecycle and mutation checks for these paths.

## 0.57.0

### Patch Changes

- e7c702a: The jcode connector now reports the provider route serving a seat's model to presence, and `cotal ps --wide`/`--json` surface it as `provider`.
- 6f64bcc: The manager's `slots` command and `cotal ps --slots` list a static manager's durable static slot rows, projected the same way `inspect` reports a stranded name.
- 42448fa: A DM send now reports the stored sequence and the recipient's status at send instead of a bare success, and `cotal deliver pending <name>` reads a recipient's held DMs from the broker.

## 0.56.1

### Patch Changes

- 6b76946: A seat resumed from a preservation cut backfills its channels from the chat stream sequence its prior incarnation had reached instead of replaying the whole retained window.

## 0.56.0

### Patch Changes

- e506040: Plane-3 durable fan-out and membership-transfer publishes omit `Nats-Msg-Id` for an `id: ""` message instead of deriving one from the empty id, so two distinct id-less posts on a durable channel both reach a member instead of the second being collapsed by the broker's duplicate window (#673). A message with a real id keeps its idempotent publish key unchanged.
- 8dc7c92: `doctor auth --fix` takes the mesh's one daemon-credential renewal lease before it re-signs when the broker answers, refuses with the live holder and the recovery named while a manager or another doctor holds it, and records and prints an explicit offline repair when the broker does not answer (#1063).
- 99cad7b: A membership watch that closes after setup now reaches its caller through a second callback on `watchMembership`, instead of leaving the caller holding a stale snapshot with no signal. The dashboard broadcasts the existing membership-read-failed event and the console marks the feed unreadable, instead of both keeping the last snapshot silently (#485).
- 1218786: The broker probe gates a plaintext dial on the server's INFO greeting on a socket it owns, so a broker that completes the TCP handshake but greets after the budget no longer leaves an orphaned socket that keeps the process alive; a TLS-required or websocket dial keeps the handshake-only gate (#2156).

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- 888e9bc: Create each space's artifact Object Store with no byte cap, so it reserves nothing against the broker's JetStream file store.

  nats-server reserves a stream's whole `max_bytes` against the server's `max_file_store` the moment the stream is created, empty or not, and refuses the next stream with JetStream error 10047 (`insufficient storage resources available`) once the reservations would pass the cap. Every space's artifact store was created at 4 GiB, so the per-space artifact quota bounded how many SPACES a broker could hold rather than how many bytes a space could write. On one production host nine spaces reserved 36.56 GiB of a 36.75 GiB cap while all nine stores together held 6,060 bytes, and the tenth space could not be provisioned. Reproduced on a real broker under `max_file_store: 9 GiB`: two spaces provisioned, the third refused with 10047, `reserved_storage` 8.19 GiB, 0 bytes stored.

  The trade-off, plainly: artifacts are now bounded by the broker's file-store cap, like every other stream a space owns (`chat`, `dm`, `inbox` and `delivery` already carry `max_bytes: -1`), and no longer by a per-space quota. One space can therefore fill the broker's store with artifacts where before it could fill only its own 4 GiB. An operator who wants a per-space artifact bound sets it on the store deliberately, and setup will refuse to widen it. `discard: new` is unchanged, so reaching the bound still refuses a put rather than evicting an artifact whose reference is already published.

  A store left at exactly the legacy stock 4 GiB is updated to `-1` and read back, so an existing mesh releases its reservation on the next `cotal up`; the `provisioner` credential gains `$JS.API.STREAM.UPDATE` on `OBJ_<artifact bucket>` and nothing else for it. Any other positive `max_bytes` was a deliberate decision and is still refused as drift. Every other drift check on the store is unchanged: subjects, mirror/sources, `discard: new`, file storage, limits retention, rollup headers, `max_age: 0`, sealed, and the message and size limits. `ARTIFACT_STORE_MAX_BYTES` is removed from the public surface.

  The old comment claimed 4 GiB was "roughly sixteen artifacts at the 256 MiB per-artifact ceiling". No such ceiling exists or existed: a 257 MiB put succeeded against a stock store, and the 256 KiB bound in the codebase belongs to contract artifacts (SPEC §13.7), which are a different thing. The claim is gone and no ceiling was added.

- 2e13607: Let a remote participant supervisor spawn and terminally release a HOST-OWNED managed agent (#1972). A registered participant holds no ledger writer, no JetStream provisioner, and no signing seed, so `cotal spawn <actor> -d --on <instanceId>` previously failed in auth preflight and a despawn refused outright.

  `@cotal-ai/core` adds the two closed wire operations and their parsers: `manager-managed-agent-enrollment` and `manager-managed-agent-prepare-retirement`. An enrollment carries the SHA-256 digest of the agent's standing actor token and never the token, and carries no lifecycle UID at all; a prepare-retirement's `opId` must be `managedRetirementOpId(target.lifecycleUid)`.

  `@cotal-ai/auth` adds `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentEnrollment` and `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentPrepareRetirement`, which require `supervise` at the caller instance's current open manager gate with the host-issued registration proof, plus the loopback door `POST /manager-service-authority/verify-enrollment` (`VERIFY_ENROLLMENT_PATH`) that a host platform calls for the decision while it owns every write. The door derives the caller's scope from the local ledger rather than the request body. `dispatchManagerAuthorityRequest` refuses both kinds with `unimplemented`, since stock owns no such storage, and the provider gains the `enrollRemoteManagedAgent` and `prepareRemoteManagedAgentRetirement` clients.

  `@cotal-ai/manager` adds the `remoteAuthority.enrollManagedAgent` hook and takes it in `provisionUserAgent`: the participant generates the actor token, writes it at 0600 before the request, sends only the digest, adopts the HOST's chosen lifecycle UID, and launches `agent-bearer --exchange-url`. `prepareAgentRetirement` now performs the host release instead of throwing.

- 357af9f: `cotal_spawn` accepts an optional manager instance id. Core resolves and invokes that exact instance without placing the pinned handle in the class cache, while malformed, unreachable, or credential-conflicting pins fail instead of falling back to class anycast.

### Patch Changes

- 810814b: Warn when a per-member delivery durable binds on a plane with no ready delivery lease.
- 8472dc3: `cotal_channels` reports a durable channel's delivery health from the daemon's own answer: `active` requires a live lease and a membership round-trip that lists the channel for this lifecycle, a daemon that answers nothing renders `degraded`, and a reader that cannot establish it (a responder-present error) renders `unknown` instead of omitting the clause. `CotalEndpoint.fetchMemberships()` is public for that round-trip (issue #445).
- f272f71: Bound the display-name and policy-channel length at the shared validators (`MAX_NAME_LENGTH` 128, `MAX_CHANNEL_LENGTH` 4096), so an over-long name or channel is refused with the bound named instead of minting a credential that exceeds the broker's `max_control_line` and silently hanging the connect (issue #375). The mint itself refuses a user JWT whose byte size exceeds the control line minus the CONNECT envelope (`MAX_MINTED_JWT_BYTES`), so many individually valid channels cannot compose into a credential the broker drops.
- a83dd80: Preflight reports a probe that ran out of its budget as a slow link instead of a trust failure: `probeConnect` now returns a distinct `timeout` reason, `preflightTarget` routes it to a new `slow-link` verdict without consulting the INFO greeting, and the rendered sentence names the connect budget and says the registry entry was kept, never a CA. A real certificate failure against a TLS-required mesh still renders the `tls-trust` guidance.
- db9a969: Escalate consecutive presence write failures after one liveness TTL and label connector roster snapshots as not live until a write succeeds.
- d284ee6: A manifest or spawn prompt on a connector that cannot deliver one is refused at preflight (including `up -f --dry-run`), at spawn and in the manager, the way an unsupported model variant is: connectors now declare `supportsPrompt`, and claude, opencode, codex, jcode and pi declare it; hermes keeps its launch-time throw as the second line of defence.
- d3d6742: Name the compiler's generated-code shape and the overflowing property count when a wide but legal contract schema overflows the call stack at compile, instead of blaming the caller's schema. Flip the schema-profile Ajv pin to `allErrors: true`, which raises the stack-bounded compile ceiling roughly 3.4x at any given stack budget without changing any validation verdict.
- fd58782: The session smoke now grades that a differently signed grant for the same session never re-releases the winner's credential.

## 0.54.0

### Minor Changes

- 34beea1: Route user-auth manager calls through a short-lived, instance-bound control credential. Discovery and invocation address the same authorized manager while the agent's standing connection, credentials and conversation remain unchanged. Managed launches retain their manager selection across launch and resume. Static and open mesh routing is unchanged. Confirm the standing goal-progress subscription at the broker before submitting on the separate control connection, so fast terminal events cannot outrun the subscription. Recover accepted goal results through the manager's caller-scoped `goal-result` command after connection replacement, without repeating the mutation or granting clients raw JetStream reads. Followed calls now require a compatible manager before submission; update the issuer, participant manager and client together. Stopping a caller cancels its observation without cancelling the accepted goal. Retain Linux custody records across clean child exit so retirement can prove process identity and finish cleanup even after the custodian removes its file; socket loss alone never frees the alias.

### Patch Changes

- e6badb8: Bind the delivery daemon's store-identity answer to the process that reloads

  The delivery-admin rail is queue-grouped, so the `reloadStoreIdentity` challenge is served by
  whichever bound responder the broker picks, while only the holder of the space's delivery lease
  actually reloads the standing credentials. The reply was a bare store identity and named no
  process, so a non-holder answering with a matching store let a manager conclude the stores were
  shared and remint into a store the reloading daemon never reads.

  The reply now carries the answering endpoint's identity and its own lease claim. The manager reads
  the delivery lease row itself, under its own credential, and requires the answerer to be the
  recorded holder. The answerer's claim is kept as a cross-check that must agree, so an honest
  non-holder is refused by its own admission and the operator-facing reason says which responder
  answered and who holds the lease. An unreadable lease row is undetermined and refuses, consistent
  with the existing convention that a hung rail fails closed.

  The supervisor credential gains a read-only point read of the delivery lease bucket, which is what
  lets the manager establish the holder itself rather than take a responder's word for it. It gains
  no write, delete or purge on that bucket: a credential able to write the row could manufacture the
  fact the challenge reads.

  A manager newer than its delivery daemon receives the old reply shape. That is refused with a
  message naming the mismatch rather than silently accepted, and each daemon's own renewal timer
  remains the adoption backstop.

  A rail that reports no responder is no longer read as an absent daemon on its own. The manager
  settles that outcome from the lease row too: a row naming a holder while the rail answers
  nothing is undetermined and refuses (a live daemon went unanswered, which must not certify a
  remint), a row the manager cannot read refuses the same fail-closed way, and only an absent or
  holderless row reads absent, the state that lets a manager without a bound daemon still take
  renewal ownership.

- b4317fd: Add a short-lived manager-caller view that binds user-auth control requests to one live manager instance on the instance rail.

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes

- 104921c: Let remote user-auth managers renew registration executors and recover stopped or frozen manager registrations through host-scoped eviction and guarded reconciliation.

### Patch Changes

- 83617ab: Allow trusted workflow hosts to bind the run-stable caller and mediator grants to an authenticated owner. Preserve existing static/local callers and keep driver grants confined to their run. This prepares the owner-binding primitive; user-auth workflow execution remains unavailable until admission and remote mediation are integrated.

## 0.52.1

### Patch Changes

- 5784ec9: Bind the user-auth service readiness wait to the daemon process, not a clock alone. A same-root `cotal up` refresh run right after a broker reload killed the old auth-service daemon used to give up at a fixed 15s while the replacement daemon it launched was still binding, then a second identical `up` succeeded: a one-shot false "auth service not ready". `ensureAuthService` now passes the pid it launched (or found live) into the provider's `ready()`, which waits past the base timeout up to 60s while that pid is provably alive, ends the wait at once when the pid exits ("exited before becoming ready"), and refuses at the bound naming the live pid, the pid record, and the service log ("alive and still starting"). `AuthServiceSpec.ready` in core gains optional `pid`/`maxWaitMs` inputs; callers that pass none keep the old clock-only behavior.

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ee8eef: Let a workflow-spawned seat answer an ask or escalated checkpoint addressed to its own incarnation with its baseline credential. `run-answer` is now self-targeted, the manager checks the caller against the pending relay before writing an answer, connector turn text renders the hosted command without `--by`, and that literal command reuses the managed seat's issued caller identity. Other seats, unrelayed checkpoints, other runs, and run start or resume remain refused. Fixes #1877.
- 2e7558d: `Part`'s data arm is `{ kind: "data"; data: unknown }` no longer: `data` is now the exported `JsonValue` (null, boolean, finite number, string, an array of JSON values, or a plain object of JSON values), and every publish path (`unicast`, `multicast`, `anycast`, `multicastExpecting`) refuses a non-JSON value at ANY depth at runtime with a named error that names the offending member's path (e.g. `data[2].at is not a JSON value`). Before, a value `JSON.stringify` silently rewrote could reach the wire: `undefined` became a keyless `{"kind":"data"}` row that history returned while Plane-3 durable delivery terminated it as malformed, and `NaN`, `Infinity`, `Date`s, sparse arrays, `Map`s, and `Buffer`s were rewritten to values a reader cannot distinguish from real ones; nested bigints and cycles threw from stringify instead of the named error. A `data` part carrying `null` or any other JSON value is unchanged. SPEC §5 states the rule. The delivery daemon's feedback intake keeps publishing its record as a data part with type declarations only (no runtime change). Refs #1404.
- 5b2c19f: Let hosted workflow runs resolve an existing absolute working directory on the selected manager and launch the placed seat in its canonical path.
- b3db3a2: `channelHistory`, `dmHistory`, and `multiChannelHistory` return `HistoryMessage[]` instead of `CotalMessage[]` (`HistoryMessage` is a checked-row alias of `CotalMessage`, so existing consumers compile unchanged). Checked before a row is returned: a usable string `id`, a full `from` (`id`/`name` strings, `role` a string when present), a finite `ts`, a string `space`, `parts` whose every member is an object with a string `kind`, `mentions` an array of strings when present, `replyTo` and `contextId` strings when present. One member is deliberately not held to the full shape: a `parts` member is checked readable, not validated by the Plane-3 part guard, so a pre-#1404 keyless `{kind:"data"}` row is still surfaced. Before, the drain's gate checked only that a stored row was an object with a usable string `id` and an object `from`, so a row like `{"id":"...","from":{"id":"..."}}` on a valid subject with a matching sender came back as a `CotalMessage` with `ts`, `space`, and `parts` undefined and `from.name` undefined, and consumers reading those fields (`partsToText(msg.parts)`, `new Date(msg.ts)`, `msg.from.name`) failed after a successful history call. Now such a row is dropped, never returned with a member silently `undefined`: the drain checks a full `from` (`name`, and `role` only when a string), a finite `ts`, a string `space`, and `parts` the drain could read (an array — held to readable, not to the Plane-3 `isCotalMessage` guard, so a pre-#1404 keyless `{kind:"data"}` row is still surfaced). The type the drain establishes internally is its own `HistoryDrainEnvelope`, which says only what the drain checked. Refs #1413.

### Patch Changes

- d69aefd: Surface a broker-refused cast or liveness probe as `permission-denied` naming the refused subject. `epCast` resolved as success and `epProbeInstanceInterest` expired into `unknown` when the broker refused their publish, because a NATS publish violation is asynchronous while the publish call returns normally. Both verbs now watch the connection status with the shared publish-denial watch, registered before the publish and released on every path, so a refusal never reads as a cast that was sent or as a verdict-less probe that consumed its whole budget. The healthy paths are unchanged: an allowed cast settles on its flush round-trip, and only the broker's no-responders answer remains an affirmative `gone`.
- c44aaf8: Show a settled workflow pause's accepted answer and attribution in the run journal.
- fe81419: The delivery daemon now watches its own shard lease key with a KV watch and quiesces at the delivery latency of that row's update instead of waiting for its next renew tick, so a takeover no longer leaves two processes serving one shard for up to a full renew period. The delivery credential gains the read-axis consumer rows on the lease bucket that the watch's ordered consumer needs.
- 93b42cd: Revive the membership feed's data connection when a later adoption proves a fresh rw credential after the client has closed conn B. Refs #1558.
- a069948: Order same-epoch presence evidence by settle, not start: a settle (success or refusal) is the latest evidence only while no put that started after it has already settled, and a newer put merely in flight supersedes nothing. An earlier put that settles after a later put settled no longer speaks, so a late success cannot erase a newer refusal record and a record can no longer outlive a write the bucket accepted. The cross-epoch fence is unchanged. Refs #1461.
- ab0808c: `cotal up --max-file-store <bytes>` sets the broker's JetStream file storage cap. Before, the rendered broker config carried only `store_dir`, so nats-server always sized its store at start as three quarters of the free disk and an operator on a shared disk had no supported way to bound it. `serverConfig` and `openServerConfig` take an optional `maxFileStore` byte count and render `max_file_store` inside the `jetstream{}` block; left unset, the rendered config is byte-identical to before, and a zero, negative or non-integer value throws naming the option. The cap is recorded on the mesh entry, carried through `down --preserve-state` into the resume, and rendered again by the bare `cotal up` that resumes it. A resume or a refresh of a running mesh that asks for a different cap is refused, because nats-server fixes the cap at start and refuses a reload that changes it. The flag is refused with `-f`. Fixes #1888.

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- db18070: Apply a signed-in account's space catalog to the registry under the provider's catalog lock, and
  record in the cache whether the snapshot was applied in full. A command that dies or is stopped
  while applying no longer leaves a partial registry that fresh and not-modified refreshes accept:
  the next command applies the cached snapshot again first. `prepareSpaceCatalogs` and
  `syncSpaceCatalogAfterLogin` now take the consumer's `apply`.
- 64d723e: Enable the AG-UI event plane by default for connectors that publish one. Operators and peer spawns
  can opt out explicitly, while connectors without an event plane refuse unless that opt-out is set.
- ec8649b: Preserve the closed required-events registration policy and enforce it across discovery, launch,
  grant coverage, direct connector sessions, and trusted upgrades of existing manual registrations.

### Patch Changes

- ade42d5: A complete observer scan that matches no connection answers verified-gone without loading or dialling the evictor credential. A live match still requires it, and an incomplete scan stays unverified (#1808).
- 4f153ab: Report transport and connection down when a post-connect endpoint bind fails and closes its partial connection. Fixes #1449.
- eb65c9b: Add the hosted environment provider contract types, validated HTTPS bearer sources, bounded nonsecret environment records, checkpoint read-out shapes, lifetime extension capabilities, and host enrollment facts. The provider facts type carries no engine (host enrollment facts are authoritative for it) and leaves volumeId optional, absent meaning the provider did not report it.
- 4dd4b90: Add harness-reported presence conditions, opaque environment references, binding diagnostics, and compact roster rendering.
- a0c8a59: Discover a signed-in account's advertised spaces lazily, cache validated snapshots, and add `cotal sync` for explicit refreshes.
- c18c055: A manager whose boot inventory has no available connector no longer takes unpinned `spawn` or `launch` on the class `one` rail. Those commands stay on scatter and on this instance's `inst` rail, so a sibling that can launch them can win the queue, and a caller that pins this instance still gets a named harness refusal. `describe` still lists the commands. Manager `status` reports `classSpawn` for that skip (cluster revision 15). A partial inventory keeps the class rail; a harness refusal there names `--on`, because the standing serve credential cannot read sibling inventories.
- f178611: Preload every persisted per-space auth-callout account when a shared broker starts, and refuse incomplete user-auth state before writing its resolver config.
- 21407fd: Allow foreground seats to redeem one-time remote user-auth enrollments, bootstrap stock mesh records, and launch without a cached human login.

## 0.50.1

### Patch Changes

- c499a85: `cotal run ps --local` now reads the revocation marker beside each run record and prints `revoked`
  for a run that carries one, whatever state the record itself holds, with the revoker and the reason
  under the table. A revocation is a create-only marker in the admission store and nothing rewrites
  the record, which is written only by a driver, so a driver that died mid-run left `running` behind
  with nothing left to write anything else: `resume` refused on the marker while the table listed the
  same run as live indefinitely, and an operator counting capacity from it counted that row. A run
  whose marker could not be read prints `unchecked` in the `STATE` column, since a failed read is
  absence of evidence rather than evidence of absence. The reason and the record's own state go to
  stderr, every other row still prints, and the command exits 1. The change is display only: a revoke
  writes no terminal state, because no host drove the run to one. `revoke` now says what the table
  will show, and `readRunRevocation` reads the marker alone so a listing does not refuse over a run
  with no admission record. `revokeRunAdmission` refuses a revocation with an empty `by` or `reason`
  before it writes, since the argument parser passed `--by ""` through and the permanent marker it left
  printed as `revoked by  ()`; a marker already written that way still reads as a revocation.

### Minor Changes

- 6f248ac: Enumerate broker spawn sites so an unmigrated suite fails the gate instead of leaking

  The reaper claims a leaked `nats-server` by matching the store-dir token in its argv, and its header
  states the standing condition: it "is only ever as complete as the migration that mints the token".
  #1008 measured what that costs, 108 orphaned brokers on one box in a day, all holding loopback ports
  inside the OS ephemeral range that suites draw from. The five suites it named were migrated, and
  nothing was left behind that could notice the sixth.

  `pnpm smoke:broker-migration` is that missing piece. It names no filenames: it walks `git ls-files`,
  finds every call that starts a `nats-server`, and fails when one is not claimable by the reaper or
  killable by the teardown helper. A suite added next week is in the population on the commit that
  adds it. The census currently reads 319 spawn sites across 297 files, and the gate checks all 315
  that are in scope.

  The census found 98 unadopted sites, not five. Two conditions each break the chain on their own and
  both are now required: the token has to be in a path the broker is STARTED with, since the reaper
  reads argv and nothing else, and the handle has to reach `teardownOnSignal`, since the token only
  helps once the owner is dead. Three shapes were leaking for reasons a named list would never have
  surfaced. A suite minting a tokened store dir but launching with `-c <conf>` put the token somewhere
  argv never carries, so it was unclaimable despite looking migrated. Brokers started with neither
  `-sd` nor `-c` left no evidence at all; those now pass a tokened `-sd` purely as a marker, which
  `nats-server` accepts without JetStream and writes nothing into. And suites that owned one broker
  while leaving a sibling unowned read as clean under any file-level check, so ownership is decided per
  spawn site.

  A deliberate negative control opts out with a `SMOKE_BROKER_UNADOPTED_OK` marker, which is greppable
  and per-site rather than a silent exclusion: `reaper.smoke.ts` must be able to start an untokened
  broker, since that is the case it exists to detect.

  The teardown helper no longer stalls three seconds and then reports a false alarm on every green
  run. It waited on `process.kill(pid, 0)`, which keeps succeeding for a child that has been killed but
  not yet waited on, so a suite whose own `finally` kills the broker first left a zombie that read as
  alive until the deadline elapsed, and the helper then printed `did not exit before path cleanup`
  about a process that was already dead. Liveness now distinguishes a zombie from a running process,
  and a genuinely running broker is still waited on before its store dir is removed.

- 6cc504b: Report an unbound delivery responder instead of a healthy-looking daemon

  A delivery daemon whose `ctl.delivery` responder has not bound blocks spawn, retirement and join,
  but no operator-facing surface said so. `cotal status` printed `delivery  running (pid N)` off the
  pidfile alone, which is the identical line it prints when delivery is fully healthy. The daemon's
  own readiness lease already distinguished the two, and `cotal status --components` already read it,
  but that pass is opt-in, so an operator watching the ordinary surfaces saw a green control plane
  while every lifecycle operation failed. The boot path made the same conflation from the other side:
  when the readiness wait elapsed, `cotal up` logged one info line promising that boot durable joins
  would reconcile and then reported success, so its caller could not tell a bound responder from an
  absent one.

  Bare `cotal status` now reads the same readiness lease `--components` reads, and reports the
  responder as bound, not bound, or unchecked. An unbound responder names its consequence in the same
  line: no spawn, no retirement, no join until it binds. Bare status remains a broad, recovery
  oriented diagnostic and still exits 0, and where the lease cannot be read it says the axis was not
  checked and points at `--components` rather than implying health.

  Readiness is judged against the daemon that is supposed to be serving, not merely against the flag.
  A daemon that dies without releasing its lease leaves its `ready` record in the bucket until the
  lease TTL expires it, so for that window a restarted or crashed mesh could still report a bound
  responder off the previous daemon's record. Both surfaces now compare the lease holder against the
  daemon this workspace launched and report a leftover record as not bound, naming it as a dead
  daemon's record that clears on its own. Where the holder genuinely cannot be known, such as an
  adopted daemon this process did not start, the holder is not checked and behaviour is unchanged.

  `cotal up` either binds the responder or states that it did not and what that prevents; the promise of a reconcile stays, but as
  a statement that the wait is open ended and that agents do not need respawning, rather than as the
  only thing said. A denied join now names the delivery daemon as a possible cause alongside
  credentials, instead of sending an operator holding valid credentials after the wrong hypothesis.

  `cotal doctor auth` no longer reports a healthy fleet as broken. When a daemon re-mints an agent's
  credential, the previous incarnation's file stays on disk, expired, and every one of those was
  reported as `EXPIRED - the broker denies this credential` with the remedy `respawn the agent`.
  Following that remedy destroys live sessions to repair nothing, because the running agent is already
  using its successor. Superseded incarnations are now recognised from the credential family that
  names them, reported as leftover files with a cleanup that is explicitly not a respawn, and excluded
  from the verdict, while a credential that genuinely has no successor is still a problem. The remedy
  for a recoverable credential now says that a running manager re-mints it and that the agent adopts
  the new file without being restarted; `respawn` is reserved for material no renewal pass can rescue.
  The doctor also names an unbound delivery responder when the recorded renewal pass hit one, so the
  surface an operator reaches for when credentials look wrong can say that credentials are not the
  fault.

- 87dda9f: The caller half of a durable spawn's physical working directory, pinned to one manager instance

  A durable spawn can name a physical working directory with `cwd`, and doing so requires an explicit
  `placement` target naming one manager instance as `{ endpoint, instanceId }`. A directory is
  host-local, so a `cwd` with no target would ride the class anycast queue and land wherever the
  anycast fell; that combination refuses rather than guessing, with no fallback. The target is
  hashed into the step identity beside the directory, so a replay retargeted at a different instance
  diverges as a migration instead of replaying a resolution taken against the old host. Logical
  `worktree` keeps its meaning and its exclusivity, and a spawn that names neither option hashes
  exactly the object it hashed before, byte for byte, so recorded runs replay unchanged.

  **Explicit `cwd` placement does not resolve yet on a shipped manager, and refuses by name until it
  does.** What ships here is the caller half: the language forwards and hashes the options, the
  runtime asks its pinned target to state the directory's canonical form before it submits anything,
  and the core grant builder mints the instance-pinned rails that ask would need. The question is
  asked with a `resolve-cwd` command, and **no manager in this release serves `resolve-cwd`** — the
  only servers of it are the smoke suites that grade this code. So on a real manager every explicit
  `cwd` placement ends in a named refusal saying that this manager serves no `resolve-cwd` command
  and can therefore state no canonical form. That is the intended direction and it is not a crash:
  nothing is submitted, allocated or launched, and the caller is told why. A non-`ok` reply and a
  reply whose path is not absolute are refused the same way. Until a manager serves the command,
  treat `cwd` with `placement` as unavailable rather than as a directory that silently differs from
  the one you named.

  The grant surface and the serving surface are deliberately asymmetric, and it is worth stating
  plainly: `runMediatorGrants` does mint the three placement capabilities (`describe`, `resolve-cwd`,
  `spawn`) for the one named instance when a program names a target, bounded to that instance with
  no anycast rail and no wildcard, but the manager's hosted-run credential minting never passes a
  program's placement into it, so an authenticated hosted run receives none of those rows today. The
  rails are built and graded; nothing production yet asks for them or answers them.

  A malformed `placement` is now refused by name at the call. `placement: null` used to raise a raw
  `TypeError` from inside the interpreter's identity projection, with no code, no effect kind and no
  journal entry, because the option reader guarded the option bag being null rather than the value it
  held. A primitive, an empty record and a half-filled record were quieter and worse: they were
  forwarded, projected two undefined fields into the step identity, and the run carried on under an
  identity describing a placement the program never named. All of these are now `L3048`, raised
  before the step key is minted, so nothing is journalled and the repair is an edit to the program.

- fc6f0b1: Scope an unanswered endpoint verdict to the rail the request rode

  A CLI whose caller carries an issued generation rides the versioned `ep.v1` rail. SPEC 13.15 makes
  that rail a separate subject space from the legacy `ep` rail and requires an endpoint to serve
  both, so a manager built before the versioned rail serves `ep` alone and never receives the
  request. The describe waited out its whole budget and every hosted `cotal run` verb reported that
  no manager answered on the endpoint rails, asked whether one was running, and offered `--local`,
  against a manager that was up, on the roster and answering `cotal ps` throughout. `--local` drives
  the run from the calling process and names the caller as the run's answerer, so an operator who
  took the suggestion would submit an answer under the wrong identity.

  The unanswered marker now carries the `ep` plane the request was published on, and `describe`
  names it in its own refusal. `cotal ps` and the other manager verbs state the reachability verdict
  against that rail instead of against the mesh, and say what silence on a versioned rail does not
  establish. `cotal run`'s hosted verbs do the same and drop both the question and the `--local`
  suggestion there, since neither follows from what was observed. On the legacy rail every message is
  unchanged: there is no second rail its silence could be hiding a manager on.

  No fallback describe is issued on the other rail. A caller holds broker rows for its own rail only,
  so the request would be refused at publish rather than answered.

- 4ab8b4b: Serve a space from more than one manager, with one renewal owner

  A manager whose workspace root differed from the delivery daemon's was refused at construction, so
  an auth-mode space could only ever have one manager. A participant machine could not run a manager
  for a space it had joined, and a second manager on one machine from another checkout could not start
  either.

  The store-identity proof stays and still runs before every remint, but a divergent answer now
  decides ownership rather than admission. That alone is not enough: the comparison is pure equality
  with no holder and no tiebreak, so every manager sharing one store passes it, and two owners
  reminting on independent timers have no ordering between them. One write then lands between the
  other's re-sign and its fingerprint-only `reloadCreds`, which is the adoption refusal the proof
  exists to prevent.

  Ownership therefore requires both the identity match and a per-space renewal lease, one
  CAS-acquired key in the manager bucket. The lease is kept alive against that bucket's TTL and
  claimed before the first remint, because that remint re-signs through the store and on a slow store
  outlasts the TTL by itself. A holder that dies has its lease expire so a survivor takes over with no
  operator step, and a clean stop hands it back at once. A manager that owns neither condition starts,
  serves its seats, skips the remint, and writes no renewal record because it re-signed nothing.

### Patch Changes

- 06eccc3: A bearer refresh now refuses two kinds of answer from the source, and it no longer refuses a third
  that was never wrong.

  Refused: a token that has already expired. It is unusable whatever else is true of it, and an
  advancement comparison lets one through, because a candidate dying at `now - 5s` does advance a held
  token that died at `now - 60s`. Adopting it overwrote the cached token with material nothing can
  dial, emitted no recoverable warning (the fetch had not failed), and armed the next read off a
  non-positive delay. The credentials path draws the same line on expiry alone.

  Refused: the byte-identical token the endpoint already holds, when that token can no longer carry
  another cycle. This is the #1561 loop. The next refresh is armed from the token just fetched, and a
  token inside its own 60-second margin computes a non-positive delay, which the arming floor turns
  into five seconds. The next read returned the same near-dead token and computed non-positive again,
  so the endpoint hit the auth service every five seconds for the rest of that token's life. The
  15-second retry backoff never applied, because the fetch had not failed: it succeeded and returned
  nothing new. Such a fetch is now treated as a failed renewal, with one recoverable warning and the
  normal backoff, and the cached token is left in place.

  No longer refused: a token that was genuinely re-issued but carries the same `exp`. Expiry claims
  have one second of resolution, so a key rotation that re-signs the same claims under a new key, and
  a short-lived source read twice inside one wall-clock second, both produce one. An earlier rule
  compared expiry and called these stale, which backed off fifteen seconds against material the broker
  had just started requiring.

  The five-second arming floor is unchanged and deliberately so: a deployment whose whole token
  lifetime sits inside the refresh margin is legitimate, and for it that floor is the renewal cadence.

  The first fetch is unchanged as well: there is no cached token to protect, and startup has to come up
  on whatever the source has. The pre-dial guard continues to refuse to present a dead one.

- 5e23b1d: Keep the versioned rail's subject token out of source comments

  The issued-profile census scans every shipped source for the versioned rail's subject token and
  allows only core's subject and grant builders to spell it. Five comments in core, the CLI and the
  runtime spelled the token and failed that cell on main. They now say "the versioned rail" or "the
  versioned plane". No code changes.

- aaedc42: `cotal run journal` renders an expired checkpoint differently from an answered one. A settled
  checkpoint's status is `ok` whether its pause was answered or expired, and the journal render took
  the status, so both read `ok` and an operator could not tell an unanswered human gate from a
  timeout. The render now reads the disposition the settle named (`resolved` / `expired`) from the
  settled result, in both the `--local` journal path and the hosted status view, and keeps the
  settled status for steps whose result is not a checkpoint disposition.
- fe813fe: The membership feed now decides "the renewal owner has not re-signed yet" by credential GENERATION
  rather than by envelope bytes. The refusal compared two whole creds envelopes with `===`, which tests
  transport representation rather than identity: the envelope carries the nkey seed and is sensitive to
  formatting, which is exactly why `credsFingerprint` hashes the JWT instead. The rw source is
  caller-supplied and opaque — a secret-store adapter, an editor, a filesystem round trip — and any of
  them can hand back the same credential in a differently formatted envelope. Compared by bytes that
  read looked like a fresh generation, so it was adopted past its own renewal point, the next renewal
  tick was floored to one second, and the feed re-read the store every second for the rest of the
  credential's life. The 60-second retry never applied, because the fetch had not failed: it succeeded
  and returned unusable material.
- 55dae63: The membership feed's conn B now refuses to present an rw credential it has already decoded as
  expired. The cached credential only ever advances through a preflight-proven adoption, so it cannot
  hold an unproven generation, but a legitimately proven one expires as the clock advances. With
  re-signing stopped, the broker closed conn B at the credential's `exp` and the client's own redial
  presented the dead credential: an auth round trip that could only be denied, reported to the host as
  the broker's "User Authentication Expired" rather than the local cause. The dial is refused before
  it leaves the process, with separate messages for a feed that can renew and one that cannot, so the
  diagnostic names the applicable remedy.
- 7df3498: `startMembershipFeed` no longer leaves its observer connection open when startup fails. Conn A is
  opened first, and every step after it can throw: an rw credential source that rejects, credential
  bytes the identity parser refuses, conn B's own dial, either KV open. Before this change the only
  `drain()` in that file lived inside the handle's `stop()`, and a caller whose startup rejected never
  receives the handle — so the observer connection stayed open for the life of the process, with
  nothing left holding a reference to it. Startup is transactional now: every connection acquired so
  far is drained before the rejection propagates, and the rejection itself is unchanged, so a caller
  that already handles the failure sees exactly what it saw before.
- 438c629: Stop a run's own replay durable from failing one of its steps

  A branch of a `parallel` failed with `RunJournalReplayRaced` naming the run's own takeover consumer,
  on a run with one activation, no second driver, and sibling branches that settled normally either
  side of it. The message told the operator another driver was replaying the run and to retry the
  takeover. There was no other driver.

  The replay durable is named after the takeover, `wfj_<runId>_<takeoverId>`, and the name is unique
  per takeover because a consumer name is one subject token that no grant pattern covers in part. What
  is not one per takeover is the number of replays: a drive re-reads its journal at every effect and
  at every poll of a parked pause, so one name is created and deleted hundreds of times over the life
  of an attempt. Two things follow, and both were reachable.

  A durable can be left behind. A replay is interrupted by whatever ends its connection, a standing
  drive connection reconnecting under it or a host closing one on a parked drive, and the delete is
  the part that does not land. Measured on a live broker: closing the connection 2ms into a
  17-record replay left the durable at `delivered=17`, and the next replay on that takeover id then
  read its own leftover as another driver's half-fed consumer. That is one fault reported to a
  healthy run, since the refusing replay deletes the leftover on its way out and every replay after
  it succeeds, which is the shape the report describes.

  And two replays can share it. `RunScopeAuthority` serializes the reads it makes itself and nothing
  serializes those against the driver's other readers on the same id: `activateRun`, the no-record
  diagnostic, and a `RunHost.status` or `locate` handed the drive's lease id, all on the driver's
  connection rather than the mediator's. Measured on a live broker at 17 records, eight replays fired
  together on one id returned a torn fetch, `RunJournalReplayRaced`, and a silently EMPTY replay,
  which reads back as a run with no history.

  `replayRunJournal` now holds the two properties its own header claims. Replays on one durable run
  one at a time in the process, keyed by the name rather than by any one caller, so a new caller
  cannot forget to join. A durable of that name found holding a tail is removed and remade before the
  read, because with the serialization in place it can only be this process's own leftover. The
  freshness guard is unchanged and still refuses: if the remade consumer also comes back holding a
  tail then a reader this process cannot account for is on the name, and reading its tail is the
  thing the guard exists to prevent.

- a211c52: Remove operator host names, space names and seat names from tracked comments and fixtures.

  Twelve files carried the name of a specific deployment, a specific machine, or a specific
  review seat inside comments, mutation descriptions and two test constants. The incidents they
  record are the useful part and they are kept, with the identifier replaced by a neutral
  description and the date left intact.

  The two value changes are inert. `GSPACE` in the mesh-spawn grant block is a string handed to
  the grant builder, and no assertion in that block reads it. The persona-frontmatter owner
  fixture is changed at all five sites including the equality it is compared against, and the
  suite reports 18 passed, 0 failed.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- b0aeca4: Make bare `cotal down` and `Manager.stop()` spare managed agents by default. Use
  `cotal down --with-agents` or `Manager.stop({ withAgents: true })` for deliberate destructive
  teardown. Linux PTY seats release manager-local proxy custody while their detached custodians and
  child processes continue running, and the CLI binds destructive intent to the exact live stop
  attempt so an interrupted command cannot poison a later bare shutdown. Managers launched before
  process identity pins existed remain stoppable after the documented reduced-guarantee warning:
  bare down cannot prove which SIGTERM handler that running binary carries, so it never reports the
  pre-signal seat inventory as confirmed spared. A genuinely older destructive handler may still reap
  those agents. `--with-agents` uses a one-shot handoff bound to the manager pid and the live
  stop-reservation inode, then signals unconditionally.
- 18f3df0: Validate retained remote managed agents through the authenticated host authority service

  Remote supervisors now send the retained actor token and sentinel credential only to the manager
  authority route derived from the verified exchange origin. The host fresh-checks the interactive
  operator's `supervise` grant, the host-authenticated current manager registration proof, the open
  gate and serving epoch, the target owner, and the current retained managed row. It returns only the
  non-secret authority shape.

  The manager requires the host-issued activation receipt and independently binds every response
  coordinate and authority field to the retained inventory. Missing, malformed, substituted, stale,
  redirected, cross-origin, and widened responses fail closed.

- cf6ced5: Make `cotal input` wait for the target runtime to acknowledge the PTY write before printing its byte receipt. Custodial and in-process PTY writes now return the accepted UTF-8 byte count or reject, and the manager refuses missing, partial, or failed acknowledgements with an error that names the seat. A dropped write therefore exits non-zero without a `sent` receipt instead of claiming delivery from the intended buffer.
- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.
- c9ea091: Reclaim an endpoint governance slot left held by a stopped registration

  An instance that stopped between taking the endpoint governance slot and publishing its spec left
  the slot held with no registration behind it, and every later registration for that endpoint
  refused while nothing was actually in flight. Neither documented recovery reached it:
  `cotal reconcile-gate` reopens the holder's issuance gate and does not write the slot, and
  `cotal deregister-instance` has no registration to remove.

  `registerServiceInstance` now decides whether a foreign-held slot is abandoned instead of refusing
  unconditionally. A slot is reclaimable only when the holder's issuance gate has reopened past the
  generation the slot is stamped with, which proves the hold can never be promoted, since a promote
  requires that same generation still frozen. The holder's gate is read through a new optional
  `observeHolderGeneration` seam, mirroring `deregisterServiceInstance`'s `observeGeneration`, and
  `readEndpointGateGeneration` is exported for callers to wire it. The manager wires it over the
  auth-bucket read its existing registration credential already holds. No new grant and no new writer:
  the registration path remains the governance head's only writer.

  Everything else still refuses, and the refusals are the point. A slot whose holder's gate is still
  at the stamped generation is a live registration and is never taken. An absent seam, an unreadable
  gate, a garbled generation, and an observation behind the stamp all refuse. The conflict message
  now names a remedy that reaches the state rather than one that does not.

  SPEC §13.7 states the liveness guarantee this closes: a registration that stops before its spec
  publication must not block an endpoint's registrations permanently, the abandoned determination
  must rest on durable facts rather than a liveness probe, and an implementation that cannot make it
  must refuse.

- 6fd855f: Add a target-pinned hosted manager retirement phase that preserves host release ordering, uses the existing crash-resumable auth barrier, bounds activation to the canonical contract artifacts, and keeps remote manager maintenance on fresh host-owned admin authorization without copying host ledger state to participants.
- dd6fea0: The seat record pins the custodian's and the child's process start identity, and a new `reapSeat` signals only a process whose identity matches. It also pins the boot those pids belong to: a start token counts ticks since boot, so a record that outlived a reboot names pids that now belong to other processes, and such a record is refused rather than signalled. The manager records each seat's custody reference on its static slot and, when a successor terminalizes a crashed manager's lifecycle, reaps the orphaned seat process through the runtime's custody `reap` before retiring the lifecycle. A runtime without it refuses by name and the lifecycle stays held. The custody reference is reserved before the seat is launched and rides the slot's first durable row, so a manager that dies between the launch and the slot activation still leaves a seat its successor can address; `Runtime.spawn` takes that reserved reference and must honour it. The same reference rides the rollback object a failed spawn hands its `finally`, so a manager that launched a seat and then threw reaps it in-process instead of retiring the lifecycle and freeing the alias over a running seat. Every seat id is checked against the shape `seatId` mints before it is joined to the custody root, so a forged reference is refused rather than resolved to a path outside it.

  `reserve` and `reap` are NOT on the core `Runtime` contract. They live on a manager-local `CustodialRuntime` that the built-in pty runtime implements, because a backend that delegates to an external surface (`tmux`, `cmux`, `orca`, `herdr`) owns no process to signal and no custody record to pre-mint against, so the methods would have no meaning for it rather than merely no implementation. `adopt` stays on the generic contract.

  The two crash scenarios and the in-process rollback are three suites, `smoke:orphan-seat-reap`, `smoke:orphan-seat-spawn-window` and `smoke:orphan-seat-rollback`, because one command carrying them crossed the mutation-proof command timeout.

- b00f3c1: Refuse a two-root daemon-credential composition at construction. The manager challenges the delivery daemon's reload-store identity before the first remint, and the refusal names both stores. Fingerprint-only reloadCreds stays once both sides read one SecretStore. A store declares its authority identity, or an injected adapter names its coordinate in COTAL_SECRET_STORE on both processes.

### Patch Changes

- a9c9849: Refuse to present an expired credential to the broker on every path an endpoint can reach one from, not only its own dial. The expiry check now sits on the endpoint's credential supply itself, so the reconnects the NATS client performs on its own present a credential that has just been checked instead of whatever was last fetched. Two such reconnects exist and neither goes through the endpoint's connect path: the one the broker forces when a JWT reaches its expiry, and a dial loop still retrying after an earlier drop that crosses the expiry mid-retry. The pre-expiry reconnect fence cannot stop the second, because it sets a policy flag the client only re-reads when it observes a new drop.

  An endpoint holding a static credential is now checked too, where before only a renewing one was. Explicitly reloading a credential checks the candidate locally before the preflight connection, so an already-expired re-signed generation is refused without a round trip and can never become the resident connection's credential.

  The refusal fails closed, not dead: a renewable endpoint keeps retrying on capped backoff and re-fetches from its source on each attempt, so it recovers by itself once renewal starts working. Both messages name the remedy that applies -- wait out the retry when a source can renew, replace the credential when there is none. An endpoint whose very first fetch never returned now fails with that source's own error instead of dialing with no credential at all. A credential with no expiry claim is unaffected.

- 348b8b7: Surface a broker-refused instance-rail invoke as permission-denied naming the subject, instead of waiting out the call deadline.
- 9a334ae: Honor connector-declared startup confirmation prompts in PTY seats by matching normalized terminal output, pressing Enter only when the prompt appears, and failing with a named bounded error when it does not.
- 9ff5c22: Make the first manager identity on a fresh root an exclusive create. Of N concurrent starts, exactly one process mints the instance file and the others adopt that identity or refuse with a named error, so they cannot take two leases.
- 159c5f0: Merge a complete agent file passed as a cotal_persona prompt into one frontmatter block. Authored channel grants, role, and agent survive load, explicit tool arguments win, and a malformed leading fence is refused rather than wrapped.
- 5079c89: Rebind a presence watch that goes silent under a live connection, and stop `cotal ps` from printing a liveness verdict while the manager's own presence view is stale.

  On netcup on 2026-09-09 the presence stream was deleted and recreated while the manager kept its
  connection. Its ordered consumer re-created itself from the old cursor against a stream whose
  sequence had restarted, the broker kept sending it idle heartbeats, and nothing ever re-created the
  watch. The manager's roster froze at the pre-recreation snapshot for hours: `cotal ps` printed
  `mesh offline` for every seat older than the freeze and `not in roster` for every seat younger,
  while a fresh observer saw all of them heartbeating. The lane watchdog stopped a working
  orchestrator twice on that reading.

  The endpoint's sweep already refused to age peers out while the whole bucket was silent and marked
  the view stale; that was the right verdict for a held link and the wrong end state for a dead
  consumer. When the view is stale and the transport is up, the endpoint now stops the old watch and
  binds a new one from the bucket's current state, once per liveness window, and reports the rebind
  as a warning that names the silent interval. The per-peer age-out also requires that the watch
  delivered for a full window after the peer's last heartbeat, so an observer's own deafness no longer
  emits one offline verdict per peer on the tick before the whole-bucket gate trips. A rebind that
  is still awaiting the broker when the endpoint stops or rebuilds its connection is retired: it
  installs nothing and reports nothing, so a stopped endpoint never regains a watch and a rebuilt
  one keeps the watch its fresh connection bound. A rebind that lands on a bucket with no keys is
  read two ways. An observer that does not register (a probe) learns that nobody is present: it
  retires every peer still in its roster and holds the view current until the first write, instead of
  reading its own silence as staleness and rebinding once per window while the mesh is empty. An
  observer that registers (the manager) is one of the missing keys, so the bucket was wiped since its
  last heartbeat: it re-publishes its own record, the new watch delivers it, and every other peer is
  re-observed or aged out from that delivery. It never marks itself offline on a current view.

  Each `ps` row now carries the manager's presence-view state (`meshView`: `current`, `stale`, or
  `unpopulated`), and the CLI prints `mesh unknown` with the reason instead of `mesh offline` or
  `not in roster` whenever that state is not `current`. Rows from an older manager carry no field and
  render as before.

- 5395c7c: Report a refused presence-KV write by naming the bucket and how long writes have been refused, instead of asserting the mesh is unreachable while the transport is connected. A latched presence bucket still opens and watches cleanly, so only the write reveals it; bind now fails with that detail rather than a bare timeout, and `cotal_connection_status` carries a distinct `presenceWriteFailure` field. The record is connection-scoped: it is cleared whenever a connection is torn down, rebuilt or stopped, so a later failure on a different connection cannot inherit it and be described as a bucket refusal.

  Clearing on teardown is not sufficient on its own, because a presence put can still be in flight when the teardown runs. A rebind reaches `publishPresence` through the empty-bucket path and nothing awaits that flight, so a put started on one connection could settle after the record was cleared and write its refusal onto a stopped endpoint or onto the connection that replaced it. The put now carries the same epoch fence the presence watch bind takes: a put that outlives its epoch still throws to its caller, and it no longer writes presence-refusal state that belongs to a later connection. A late success is fenced the same way, so it cannot erase a refusal the current connection established from its own evidence.

- 186fc62: Disable the NATS client's reconnect loop before an endpoint credential expires or its connection is deliberately closed, then close that connection instead of draining it. Credential-expiry closes resolve through `closed()` without an unhandled rejection, and a half-open socket cannot leave teardown waiting for a drain PONG.
- 1636927: Resume long manager re-registrations with fresh scoped authority and durable same-operation eviction progress, and document safe gate recovery and the last-resort JetStream store replacement procedure.
- 6fb1d64: Verify reconciled presence and lease TTLs with an expiring canary instead of trusting the broker's in-memory stream configuration. `cotal up` now reports a named persistence failure when a server accepts `max_age` but its backing store does not persist or enforce it.

### Minor Changes

- b6c843f: Restrict workflow driver credentials to their own journal and record writes. Move effects and leader reads onto a separate trusted host connection, with journal ownership checks, cancellation cleanup checks, and host-held wait acknowledgements. Hosted and local runs use this split; authenticated local runs now require a recorded space signer rather than a single credentials file.

  Custom run hosts must accept the separate mediator connection. Seat-adopting effect hosts must implement `restoreMigratedSeats` so migration reads stay on the host.

  Preserve settled parent history when a version-1 fork resumes through the host, without granting the child access to parent checkpoint tokens.

## 0.47.1

## 0.47.0

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.
- 18a0024: The manager hosts workflow runs. `run-start`, `run-resume`, `run-answer`, `run-status` and
  `run-ps` are served on the manager's endpoint rails; a run is validated before anything is
  recorded, driven in the manager's process under a per-run `run-driver` credential, and taken back
  from its journal after a manager restart. `cotal run` is a client of that surface by default,
  with `--local` keeping the in-process drive, now under the run's own `run-driver` and
  `run-operator` credentials rather than `admin`; an answer's writes are pinned to the one pause it
  answers. A user-auth mesh refuses the family by name until a run can carry its user's owner. A new `run` capability mints the family into an
  agent's credential and injects the `cotal_run` tool, so an agent can write a cotal-lang program
  and start it from a session. `run-answer` records the answerer from the caller's credential and
  takes no `by`; `cotal run answer` drops `--by` on the hosted path. `spawn({ supervise })` is a restart policy the manager enforces in
  place: `{ restarts, window? }` (default `10m`) until the budget is spent, then the seat is
  retired and the next `turn` is L4002. A policy this host cannot honour is refused at accept.

## 0.45.0

### Minor Changes

- 38d7bb7: Record a durable cleanup-complete marker on a terminalizing static managed slot before the final CAS to `retired`. A `terminalizing` row was previously consistent with three worlds (cleanup not started, cleanup in flight, or cleanup completed with the process dead before the CAS) that the state could not tell apart, so a resumed terminal always re-ran `cleanup()` as the only total option and the row could never assert cleanup was already done. `runStaticTerminal` now runs the footprint cleanup through one at-most-once helper that writes `cleanupComplete: true` on the `terminalizing` slot before the `retired` CAS; a resumed terminal reads it and skips a completed cleanup. The marker distinguishes the cleanup-completed world from the not-known-complete worlds (which keep the same remedy: re-run the idempotent cleanup) and adds no unrecoverable intermediate state.

### Patch Changes

- 299a353: Pin the unavailable translation for a thrown observeGeneration in deregisterServiceInstance. The new smoke:ep-traits cell holds the governance slot, throws from the observer, and asserts the envelope stays unavailable with the spec un-deleted.

## 0.44.0

## 0.43.0

### Minor Changes

- 890d08a: Complete a committed registration spec after a lost ack instead of freezing a new coordinate. Boot self-heal and `cotal reconcile-gate` now finish that same freeze when the spec advanced, and abort-reopen only on a definite no-commit.
- e5412a1: Add per-agent `cwd` to mesh manifests. Relative paths resolve on the manager host against its workspace, matching the imperative spawn option. The directory survives launch-spec validation and contributes to stale-entry detection without changing hashes for manifests that omit it.

  This implements the working-directory part of #963. Manifest session continuity remains separate work.

- 7ff0c21: Hold the endpoint governance slot through Phase-4 reopen so a concurrent deregister cannot delete the spec a registration is still completing. `deregisterServiceInstance` now requires an observe-only read of this instance's issuance-gate generation: matching the held slot is `registration-in-flight`; a slot behind that generation is a leftover after reopen and does not block.

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- a87709c: Every cotal-lang effect now performs on the mesh: the durable-action group is built end to end and
  the not-yet-durable seam is gone.

  `spawn` submits a real manager goal and returns the allocated seat's handle, and meters the
  agent's `permits` (`turns`, `wallClock`; the turn that would exceed one is L4001, and a budget the
  host cannot meter is refused at spawn); `conclave` opens a scoped sub-team as durable membership
  rows; `ask` parks schema-checked pauses answered through `cotal run answer` and tells the agent
  over the turn relay, one relay per attempt carrying the schema, the attempt and the previous
  refusal, which every connector's intake renders with the answer command; `monitor` registers the
  handle on its journal entry and `wait(down)` reads a monitored incarnation's death off presence
  liveness, refusing an agent nobody monitored.
  `turn` rides a new pull-shaped manager relay: the manager serves `turn` (targeted, the
  despawn/input reach) plus `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` (self reach, manager contract revision
  10), holds the payload on the goal-index note, pins the goal to the seat's incarnation, and denies
  at a goal-bound deadline hold; the seat side (all connectors) pulls pending turns, surfaces them
  two-phase into host context, auto-yields `done` when the host turn ends, and yields `blocked` or
  `handoff` through the new `cotal_yield` tool; the run client renders context with pending notices,
  arms its own pause on the acceptance's deadline as the L4003 authority, watches presence as the
  L4002 authority (a death the manager marks on the deadline terminal reads the same way), and
  honors handoffs (L4005/L4004 validation, the `handoffFrom` goal chain); the manager shows a seat
  one turn at a time. The relay holds on an auth mesh: the agent baseline gains the self-mode
  `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` rows, the operator seat-write set (`control-caller-admin`, the
  `admin` capability) gains `turn` beside `input`, and the manager mints the deadline hold's
  schedule over its serve connection and owner-expires the hold once due instead of reading a
  fire it holds no grant for. `wait(replied)` observes the run's own turn terminals as a level, and never a
  turn the run itself ended without an accepted yield. A `spawn` may bind a logical worktree: the
  validator rejects two literal-worktree spawns in one concurrent scope (L3022, named branch
  functions included) and the runtime claims a tree before it submits, refusing a second spawn into
  a tree held by a live seat or by a spawn in flight (L4008), with sequential reuse the moment the
  holder's presence lapses. A spawn refused at accept is L4000 (L4001 for seat capacity) and one
  whose seat never came up is L4002; an `ask` whose deadline passes with no conforming record is
  L4006; a fork copies a spawn that said `onFork: "adopt"` and refuses one that would have to
  respawn (L5019). The run driver re-issues
  recorded-but-undischarged cancellations at adoption, so recovery does not wait for completion to
  release a dead loser's seat, pause, or tree. A migration's `--adopt <handle>` hands the orphaned
  seat to the edited program's next spawn of that persona, and `--release <handle>` despawns it at
  commit through the run's own discharge; both name the agent the step spawned, and a spawn that
  produced none is an orphan like a sleep; the adopting spawn binds the orphaned spawn's goal as
  its own, so a resume re-reads the seat and a cancellation despawns it. A turn accept the manager
  cannot finish unwinds to a failed terminal on its bound goal, and a retry of it is refused naming
  that terminal. The delivery daemon hosts the checkpoint timer writer, so mediated deadlines fire
  with no suite pump.

### Minor Changes

- de258fb: `/api/activity` reads all of chat in one stream read instead of one read per channel. The CHAT
  stream already interleaves every channel into one sequence space, so the newest N across the space
  is the tail of that one stream. The new `CotalEndpoint.multiChannelHistory(channels, opts)` reads it
  with a single consumer whose `filter_subjects` are those channels, and tags each message with the
  channel the broker delivered it on rather than with the payload's own claim. A channel left out of
  the list is filtered by the broker and never crosses the link, so the dashboard's chat-only rule now
  decides the read's filter set instead of deciding which of seventy reads to issue. No new broker
  authority: a multi-filter create rides the bare `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHAT>` row the observer
  and admin profiles already hold.

  The multi-filter read batches its filter list. One consumer create naming every subject is a single
  request, but a large enough request stops being answerable: on a seeded sweep the create succeeded
  at 70, 1,000 and 5,000 channels and failed at 10,000, and what gives way is the client's request
  timeout rather than the broker. `MULTI_FILTER_BATCH` is 1,000 and `MULTI_FILTER_READ_CONCURRENCY` is
  4, so the list is split and at most four batches are in flight, and the pages are merged by stream
  sequence before the newest N are taken. The size comes from the sweep rather than from the failure
  point: a fifth of the largest count that still answered, answering in about a quarter of a second, so
  a batch stays far from both the create timeout and the 8000ms response deadline. On the same corpus
  the sweep goes from 43ms, 246ms, 5345ms and a timeout, to 54ms, 343ms, 1163ms and 942ms. Those walls
  are single runs on one host and are shaped by it rather than being bounds; a re-run on another box
  landed outside the last of them, as the paragraph below says of every span here. A space
  with the 69 chat channels this work was aimed at is one batch, so the request counts and byte totals
  are unchanged at that size. The walls are not claimed to be, for the reason just given.
  Merging on stream sequence rather than the payload's `ts` is asserted in
  `packages/core/smoke/history-recent.smoke.ts` against a corpus whose arrival order and `ts` order are
  opposite.

  Two limits remain and are stated rather than buried. On a 20,000 channel and 20,000 message corpus
  the batched read still fails at 5,000 filters and above, because batching removes the create size
  ceiling and not the cost of a batch matching a small fraction of a long stream; no unbatched
  numbers were taken on that corpus, so no comparative claim is made about it. Separately, a filter
  list big enough to exceed the connection's `max_payload` is refused by the client before anything
  is sent, rather than by the broker and rather than timing out: the client compares the request
  against the limit the broker advertised at connect and throws, so no bytes leave and the broker's
  own logs show nothing. A list of 40,000 filters on this corpus's subject shape is refused that way.
  Where the limit falls moves with both the advertised `max_payload` and the length of the subjects,
  so 40,000 is a length that was tried and not a threshold.

  Measured on the wire by a proxy between the endpoint and the broker that counts `$JS.API` request
  lines and bytes per direction, over a seeded corpus of 69 chat channels plus 24 event channels at
  limit 200. The before column is that same committed suite file, with its `package.json` script,
  copied onto a `544a974b7` checkout and run there, so it measures the old code with the new
  instrumentation: 2524 broker requests and 8,015,332 to 8,016,039 bytes across four runs to return a
  143,401-byte page. After: 143 requests and 908,410 to 908,422 bytes across eight runs, for the same
  200 entries in the same order, and consumer creates fall from 347 to 6.

  The counts are the stable claim and the walls are illustrative, and the two halves of that sentence
  have different evidence. On the completed no-link arms the request counts, the consumer creates and
  the page size are identical in every run, while the byte totals move by tens of bytes. The
  field link's two arms behave differently and the sentence has to say which. Its fan-out arm is
  truncated by the deadline, so its requests, creates and bytes vary with the clock: 794 to 849
  requests and 128 to 133 creates across thirteen runs. Its single read completes, and keeps the same
  143 requests and 6 creates it spends with no link cost, in every run. Walls vary on one host by more than the counts do. Across an 82ms RTT / 554 KB/s
  link with the shipped 8000ms deadline, the fan-out answered 16 of 70 sources in every run and timed
  out, and the single read answers whole in 4304ms to 4637ms across nine runs. On the same link the pre-change tree spends 768
  to 793 requests and 2,085,533 to 2,364,182 bytes across four runs to reach those 16 sources.

  Every span here is what its runs covered on one host. None of them is a bound. A reviewer ran the
  suite four more times while this was under review and landed outside eight of the spans as they then
  stood, by a byte or two on the totals and by tens of milliseconds on the walls, and the spans below
  have been widened to include those runs. Expect the next run to do it again. What does not move, in
  any run by anyone so far, is the request counts, the consumer creates and the page sizes of the
  completed no-link arms, the 143 requests and 6 creates the single read also spends on the field
  link, and the number of sources each field-link arm reaches: 2 of 2 for the single read, 16 of 70
  for the truncated fan-out. The fan-out's request and create counts are not in that set, because the
  deadline truncates them. 24 of 70 belongs to the pre-change tree's uncapped fan-out and to nothing
  at this head, which completes at 2 of 2 uncapped on the same 143 requests. The argument rests on the
  figures that do not move.

  `pnpm smoke:web-activity-read-cost` reproduces the after column, and beside it a frozen copy of the
  old fan-out shape as a scale-invariance control, which costs 2863 requests and 7,743,782 to
  7,744,228 bytes across eight runs. That
  arm runs the old shape on this build's one-page window, so it is a control and not the shipped
  before; the before column is the same suite run against `544a974b7`.

  History reads now open their first window one page wide instead of four. `drainWindow` delivers
  everything in the window and keeps the tail, so a four-page window moved four pages to return one
  whenever the subject was most of its stream. `/api/dms` at limit 500 against a 2500-message backlog
  moved 1,995,854 to 1,995,859 bytes across four runs to return a 346,001-byte page, at 257 requests
  every run, and took 8161ms to 8753ms alone on that link. Every one of those four runs missed the
  8000ms deadline with nothing else on the connection. An earlier draft published 8852ms and 7857ms
  here and called the read a straddle; 7857ms is below every run I can now produce, so the straddle is
  withdrawn and the read simply misses. It now moves 502,354 to 502,359 bytes with no link cost across eight runs,
  and alone on the field link takes 2532ms to 2858ms across twelve runs while moving 502,361 to
  502,365 bytes. Those are two different arms of the suite and the split is deliberate: the byte
  figure a reader should compare against the before column is the no-link one. A sparse subject pays
  one more widening step for that.

  `multiChannelHistory` refuses a channel name the wire layer would rewrite. `chatSubject` builds each
  filter through `token()`, which maps an unusable character to `_`, trims each segment and drops
  empty ones, so `foo/bar` would have filtered on `foo_bar` and `.lead` on `lead`: the caller names one
  channel and the broker returns another. `isConcreteChannel` does not catch it, because none of those
  carry a wildcard. The read now runs the same `assertValidChannel` the policy path already used
  against this aliasing, before it builds the subject. The dashboard passes canonical `listChannels()`
  rows and never reached it; the public method and its exact-filter promise did.

  `ActivitySource` (the seam `activityBackfill` reads through) replaces `channelHistory` with
  `multiChannelHistory`. The aggregation now has two sources, chat and DMs, so a partial page names
  which half is missing rather than naming individual channels.

  **The activity feed selects different messages under clock skew, and an operator can see it.** The
  page is the newest `limit` chat messages by broker arrival, unioned with the newest `limit` DMs,
  ordered by `ts`. The shape it replaces took the newest `limit` per channel and then the newest
  `limit` of that union by `ts`. With two channels and `limit=2`, channel A holding a1 (seq 1, ts 100)
  and a2 (seq 2, ts 200) and channel B holding b1 (seq 3, ts 50) and b2 (seq 4, ts 60), the old rule
  returns a1 and a2 and the new rule returns b1 and b2. They disagree whenever a sender's clock
  disagrees with arrival order by more than the spread between the `limit`-th and `limit+1`-th message.
  The display order is unchanged, since the page is still sorted by `ts`; what changed is which
  messages reach it. Arrival is the broker's own record and `ts` is a sender claim, so the new key is
  the narrower one. Per-channel selection cannot be had from a single read at any window short of one
  that has seen `limit` messages from every requested channel, since a quiet channel's newest can sit
  arbitrarily far back in an interleaved stream. That is a property of the mechanism rather than a
  measurement, and it is why the old selection was not kept.

- bac1e00: Distinguish an unpopulated presence watch from a current roster.

  `presenceView()` now returns a discriminated `current`, `unpopulated`, or `stale` state. An
  unpopulated reconnect refill carries `fresh: false`, so existing consumers fail toward unknown
  instead of treating a partial roster as an authoritative absence verdict. `waitForPresenceSnapshot()`
  now reports whether the snapshot completed or the bounded wait timed out.

  The web dashboard surfaces an unpopulated roster as still loading and keeps the existing stale-watch
  diagnostic for a view that was populated and later went silent.

### Minor Changes

- 2277e28: A capability refusal is durable and retryable. A handler that cannot perform an effect on its host
  throws the new `EffectRefused`; the interpreter settles the entry with the new status `refused`
  under the handler's code (L5016 for the mesh handler's `NotYetDurable`, which now extends it) and
  unwinds the run with the uncatchable `RunHeld` (L5025). The driver grades the run `released`, and a
  resume on a capable host finds the new `refused` lookup verdict and performs the step live, so a
  run started before the durable-action surface lands heals the day it does. Previously the refusal
  settled `failed` and a resume replayed the failure forever.

  Two concurrent `turn`s on one agent handle are serialized at the dispatch seam both engines share:
  the second begins when the first settles, in dispatch order. Turns on different handles are
  unaffected.

  A fork's child records its lineage: the run record's spec gains `forkedFrom` (`{ run, step }`,
  absent on runs started fresh), `commitFork` writes it with the spec, and `ForkCommitResult.
lineageRecorded` is now true.

  Spec: §6.5 (turn serialization), §9.2 (six uncatchables), §10.1/§10.7 (the `refused` status and
  verdict), §11.1, §11.3, Appendix A (+L5025), and SPEC.md §14.3 (`forkedFrom`).

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- e5e68ed: Add a mesh-side persona catalog read (`cotal_personas` / manager `list-personas` + `show-persona`) so a spawn-capable agent can enumerate names and show a card it owns without shelling out.
- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.
- 063151b: Expose raw NATS transport liveness separately from full endpoint readiness. Connector sessions now
  track transient disconnect and reconnect edges without flapping readiness, ignore stale events from
  replaced connection epochs, and clear both states on stop. Connection issues remain scoped to pre-bind
  readiness failures, clear on a successful bind, and survive stop for post-mortem diagnosis.

  An endpoint stopped while its bind is still in flight also no longer announces that connection.
  The bind's own teardown already discarded it, but the readiness event was emitted first, so any
  listener on the endpoint was left holding a connected edge that nothing ever corrected.

  The same applies to the transport seed, which reaches further back. It fires as soon as the dial
  returns, well before the bind completes, so a stop arriving while the dial was still pending had a
  stopped endpoint announce a live transport it never had. Both edges are now guarded.

### Patch Changes

- c31de91: Describe retry formats an arbitrary caught value without throwing, so a poisoned `message` getter or `toString` cannot escape the timer. The pending describe still settles as unavailable.
- d4779db: Treat a CONSUMER.DELETE timeout during membership-watch disarm as best-effort cleanup: catch it, emit an endpoint error, and continue. A live observer over a slow link must not die because cleanup did not answer in time.
- 6926b34: Report a focus-mode recall as incomplete (`droppedChannels`) instead of silently claiming an empty, complete window when the channel has `replay: false` or was joined only through a wildcard subscription. Previously an ack-dropped ambient message or `@mention` on such a channel was unrecoverable and `cotal_inbox` reported no loss.
- d2c0fd3: Stop the presence and channel-registry KV watches on endpoint teardown. Each watch binds an
  ordered JetStream push consumer whose idle-heartbeat monitor runs on its own timer, independent
  of the connection; without an explicit `.stop()` before drain, that monitor keeps trying to reset
  the consumer against a draining or closed connection, throwing an uncaught `DrainingConnectionError`
  every 30 seconds until the process exits by some other means.
- 7e45495: Make every shipped endpoint consumer explicitly surface or ignore recoverable warnings so retry and renewal failures no longer disappear silently.
- 135ddaf: Reject endpoint reads when JetStream denies required metadata instead of returning successful incomplete results.
- e703873: Report connector harness availability at manager boot and expose resolved binary paths in status.
- 6c1cefe: A stalled presence-KV watch no longer sweeps every peer offline. Whole-bucket silence past TTL marks the observer view stale (last-known roster kept); the dashboard surfaces that on the existing stale pill and debounces the recovery replay so the online sidebar does not empty.
- b20644b: Cancel unfinished history pulls at dashboard deadlines so abandoned reads cannot starve later requests.
- 74c9a1b: Refuse to dial NATS with cached credentials after their JWT expiry when standing renewal is failing.
- bfd650c: Retry the read-only endpoint describe bootstrap within its original deadline so a responder that registers just after the first request is still discovered.
- e6c6947: Prevent two broker owners during manager succession. Normal shutdown now requires authoritative seat exit proof before releasing manager authority, and crash recovery verify-evicts an orphaned static seat's broker principal before retiring its lifecycle and freeing the alias.
- b36bf50: Emit recoverable endpoint retry notices on `warning` instead of `error`, so a consumer with no error listener is not killed by a condition the endpoint is already surviving.
- 3cc980d: Resume an interrupted frozen endpoint-gate repair without repeating holder evictions that were
  already verified. Progress is durably bound to the registration operation, frozen-gate revision,
  and sorted holder set, while every retry still rechecks freeze-holder liveness. A mismatch restarts
  from zero, each completion is persisted before the next verification, and the gate reopens only
  after every current holder verifies. The endpoint executor can write only its exact repair key, and
  post-reopen cleanup failure cannot authorize a later freeze.
- d94b617: Keep synchronous spawn callers waiting through the connector-selected readiness budget instead of timing out early on slow healthy launches.
- eb3b429: Sparse channelHistory stops at the subject's first matching sequence instead of walking the stream to sequence 1. The page was already correct; the walk is now the channel's own span.
- 17046ac: Spawn failures return the lifecycle facts the manager already had (blocked op, head state, opId, remedy) instead of a connector timeout or opaque string.
- b7b932e: Point status skills rows at `cotal setup --skills`, with harness-native setup declared and implemented by connectors rather than the base CLI.
- 8eff985: `provisionAgent`'s agent-profile grant template emitted the JetStream consumer-create deny triple
  on the DM, TASK, and DLV streams while granting `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO` on none of them. Every
  JetStream API call is a NATS publish, so a role-carrying actor was refused stream-level state reads
  (message counts, first/last seq) on the task stream it binds its `svc_<role>` consumer to.
  `STREAM.INFO` on TASK now sits inside the same `if (role)` gate as the rest of that stream's
  grants, so it tracks the role like every other TASK row and a role-less agent still holds nothing
  on TASK. DM, DLV, and the EPC contract store get no such grant: `subjects_filter` is a
  request-body field no ACL can narrow to counts alone, so INFO there would enumerate DM and delivery
  subject metadata across peers, and no agent-side caller reads those streams at stream level. The
  consumer-create deny triple is untouched.
- b88edd9: Connectors declare `supportsToolListAnnounce` (default-deny). A connection-changing op against a connector that cannot announce a tool-list change fails loud, without naming harnesses in shared code.

## 0.36.0

### Patch Changes

- 7c5995b: Key per-tenant material per space instead of per root. The five root-scoped kinds (the `$SYS` cred pair, `membership.json`, `membership-rw.creds`, `delivery.creds`) and every per-agent standing secret now live under `space.<hex>/` segments, migrated on first touch through one choke point that refuses — loudly, with an honest remedy — on any root it cannot show to hold a single tenant. `space rm`'s step-7 reaps land with their step-1 preconditions ahead of the verb itself. Also: the delivery daemon's `$SYS` repair advice now asks the guard instead of printing commands that refuse on the roots that need them, expired user bearers stop being re-presented on reconnect (with the retry bounded), and `agentSecretKeyForFile` takes the caller's space and checks the recorded path against it, so a stored path can no longer address another tenant's material.

## 0.35.0

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 22c3182: Honor the persona file's `agent:` frontmatter when picking the spawn harness. The key existed in
  half the fleet's personas but no code path read it: it swept into the verbatim `meta` bag, and both
  launch paths resolved the connector before the persona file was loaded, so `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT`
  silently beat a deliberate per-persona pin (a `jcode` persona ran `claude` with no complaint).

  The harness now resolves once, on every spawn path, as: explicit `--agent` flag > persona `agent:` >
  `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT` > the product default. That is the precedence `model:` and `variant:` already
  have, keeping the env var a _default_ rather than an override. On `--detach` the CLI now threads
  an explicit flag and the caller's environment default as separate control fields. The manager loads
  the persona file before resolving its connector and applies the same precedence while preserving
  the invoking operator's default when its own environment differs. A pin naming an unregistered
  connector fails the spawn loudly with the connector install hint (no silent fallback).

  `saveAgentFile` round-trips the field, so a runtime `cotal_persona` redefine preserves a pin.
  Docs updated (`agent-files.md`, `connectors.md`, `cli.md`, `config.md`).

## 0.33.6

## 0.33.5

## 0.33.4

### Patch Changes

- 1858932: The manager no longer ends its own process over its liveness lease. A renew that fails is re-read; a key still its own is adopted, a gone key is re-acquired, a key held by another process is reported and served through, and a broker that cannot be asked is retried for as long as it takes. Each change of state is one line in `manager.log`. The fail-close that took a manager and every pty seat it held down one tick past the lease TTL is removed, together with the detach-on-lease-loss path it needed. The endpoint also drops its manager-lease KV handle when it rebuilds a closed connection; before, every renew after a reconnect ran on the dead handle and timed out for good.

## 0.33.3

## 0.33.2

### Patch Changes

- ffdde4d: Fix the second spawn of any persona being unmintable under per-user auth.

  In user mode the allocated agent name IS the mesh actor, and the principal grammar reserves `-` as
  the separator of the JetStream-name form, so it is rejected inside a token. The spawn auto-numbering
  scheme appended its counter with exactly that character: the second live instance of a persona was
  named `<base>-2` and could never be granted. It numbers with `_` now.

  The failure was invisible outside per-user auth, because static/open mode keys the actor on the
  freshly minted nkey rather than on the name — so it fired only on hosted meshes, only from the
  second spawn onward, and looked like a problem with one persona's name rather than with numbering.

  The name rule itself now lives in one exported predicate (`spawnNameError`) that both the manager's
  name door and the numbering are checked against, and whose narrow half delegates to the shipped
  token validator instead of restating its alphabet. In user mode a name that could never become an
  actor is refused where it is chosen, rather than at mint. Static/open mode keeps the looser rule, so
  an existing `my-agent` persona still spawns across an upgrade.

## 0.33.1

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- ba74c84: An agent now reads only the channels it lists. An omitted or empty read set means **no channels**,
  where it previously meant `general`: the agent-file loader, the provisioner, the credential mint and
  the endpoint each defaulted an absent read set to `["general"]`, so any persona that simply did not
  mention channels was subscribed to `general` by code and had the matching channel read row baked
  into its credential.

  An agent on no channel is still a full mesh peer: it appears on the roster and sends and receives
  DMs and anycasts, and the same default-deny that already governed `allowPublish` now governs reads.
  An empty list and an omitted one mean the same thing, for both read keys. That has one consequence
  worth stating plainly: when **both** are omitted, `allowSubscribe` falls back to the read set and so
  resolves empty too, which leaves the agent unable to `cotal_join` a channel at runtime. Give it an
  explicit `allowSubscribe` if it should be able to join one later.

  With no concrete channel there is no default broadcast target, so a send with no explicit channel is
  refused with a message saying so, rather than resolving to `general`. Leaving your last channel is
  allowed and always was; the `cotal_leave` description said otherwise and now says what actually
  happens, including that the default send channel is gone until you join one.

  Migration: **list `general` explicitly if you want it.** A hand-written persona that relied on the
  old default needs `subscribe: [general]` added.

  This changes the default `cotal setup` install as well. The seeded `default_agent` carries
  `subscribe: []`, which used to resolve to `general` and now resolves to no channel; it keeps
  `allowSubscribe: [">"]`, so it can still `cotal_join` anything, it just no longer arrives on a
  channel it never asked for — which is what its own seed comment already described.

  Already-running agents are not narrowed retroactively: a live seat keeps the read ACL its credential
  was minted with, across renewal, until it is respawned.

  **Correction:** the read-set default-deny described above is not new in 0.33.0. It shipped in 0.28.0
  with 86f6b10 (#821, "Remove the implicit `general` channel floor"), and so did the refusal of a send
  with no channel and the no-channel default for the seeded `default_agent`. Upgrading from 0.28.0 or
  later needs no migration for it. What 0.33.0 changed is narrower. The no-default-channel check in
  `multicast` now refuses only an omitted channel (`channel === undefined` where it was `!channel`), so
  an explicit empty-string `channel` is no longer refused as if it were omitted, and the refusal now
  says to name or join a channel. The `cotal_send` and `cotal_leave` tool descriptions and pi's send
  call line no longer name `general` as a default or say the last channel cannot be left, doc comments
  state the rule and the both-keys-omitted consequence, and the `smoke:no-implicit-general` and
  `smoke:session-channels` suites guard it.

## 0.32.0

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 4ef59c3: A spawned seat now receives a constructed environment (PATH/HOME/locale, the machine-wide COTAL\_\* knobs, connector-declared provider keys) instead of the manager's ambient environment. Host-session markers such as CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION no longer leak into seats and silently disable transcript saving. The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

- aea08f9: Allow agents to clean up their presence and channel-registry ordered consumers, wait for real mesh readiness before opening Codex, and collapse repeated endpoint errors.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e673ff: Delivery daemon: the launcher stops dropping the transport, and stops reporting a daemon it did not start.

  Two independent defects let `cotal up` print a healthy control plane over one that was not there.

  **A same-root refresh relaunched the delivery daemon without TLS (#836).** `startDeliveryWithBroker`
  re-derived the transport from `<root>/.cotal/broker-policy.json` whenever its caller passed no
  `transport` — and the refresh path never passed one, even though it had already decided the same
  fact from the mesh-registry entry and reconciled it against the live listener's `INFO`. The two
  durable records are written by different paths, so on any root that records `tlsRequired` without
  holding a policy file (registered with `cotal meshes add --tls`, or a mesh predating the policy
  file) the daemon went out flagless against a TLS-required broker. Nothing looked wrong: the client
  still upgrades on the server's unauthenticated greeting. The daemon holds a standing credential and
  reconnects unattended, so that was a repeating exposure, not a one-shot. The transport requirement
  is now a required argument to `startDeliveryWithBroker`; the policy re-derivation is gone and every
  call site names its source.

  **A stale lease answered for a daemon that had already exited (#837).** `waitForDeliveryLease`
  accepted any `ready:true` lease. A daemon killed with `SIGKILL` never releases its lease, and the
  record survives for the rest of the bucket TTL — so a replacement that lost the single-flight CAS
  and exited was reported ready off the corpse's lease, and `up` exited 0 with no daemon running and a
  pidfile fronting a dead pid. `waitForDeliveryLease` now takes `holder` and waits for that daemon
  specifically (`undefined` only when adopting one that was already running, whose id is not knowable
  from the launcher). `ensureDelivery` passes the id of the daemon it launched, and a launch whose
  process is provably gone while holding no lease now fails loud, naming `.cotal/delivery.log`,
  instead of returning success.

  `waitForDeliveryLease` now requires `holder` — pass `undefined` for the previous behaviour.

- 569f4d3: An empty message id is never a dedup key, and an id-less delivery is individually addressable at the drain seam.

  Two distinct messages that each carry an empty id collapsed to one: the receiver-side id
  dedup read empty-equals-empty as a duplicate, silently dropped the second, and once the
  first was handled it dropped every later empty-id message on arrival. Measured live, two
  such messages arrived on the wire and only the first was ever delivered.

  An empty id is now treated as no id: the ingest coalescing (pending, handled, protected)
  is skipped for it in both directions, so distinct messages that carry an empty id are all
  delivered. At the drain seam a per-delivery receive key (the wire id when there is one, a
  per-session secret-namespaced minted key when the id is empty, never on any wire) is what
  hosts, adapters, and the exact-key drain select by: cotal_inbox, the Claude Code hooks,
  the OpenCode plugin, the Codex host, the Hermes bridge and its Python sidecar, and the pi
  driver. The drain API is renamed for what it takes (drainInboxDeliveries, missingKeys).
  Eviction classification, in-flight holds, scope routing, the focus-recall tie-break, and
  the scoped drain's selection no longer key on the empty id either. The Hermes bridge no
  longer wedges on an empty-id message. Delivery pumps in core now treat an absent or
  non-string id as a malformed envelope per SPEC section 5 (durable terminate, live drop,
  history and recall skip).

  What this restores: before the receive key, an id-less delivery was unaddressable: the
  raw id swept every pending empty-id item in one drain call, and once filtering closed
  that, the item could never be drained or acked, was re-shown on every windowed inbox
  read, and on a durable channel accumulated as an unretirable entry until the 200-entry
  overflow valve evicted it, roughly a model turn of churn per entry, while one hostile
  empty-id ambient publish self-drove back-to-back host turns on the pi adapter. This was
  a violation of the SPEC section 8 ack-only-after-surfaced obligation at the receiver,
  not only an adapter defect.

  The cost is stated rather than hidden: with no id there is no coalescing either, so a
  redelivered copy of an empty-id message can surface twice on a path that is already
  at-least-once (live remains at-most-once). Dedup for real ids is unchanged: their
  receive key is their wire id and their coalescing is untouched. SPEC section 4, section
  7 item 5, section 8, and section 12 item 12 now state the receiver-scoped rule, and the
  client-builder guidance mirrors it.

  One named follow-up stays open: Plane-3 durable fan-out derives its publish msgID from
  the message id, so distinct empty-id messages can still be collapsed inside the broker's
  duplicate window on a durable channel before this receiver sees them. That path is its
  own issue; this change's guarantee is the receiver.

- ef01887: Add closed, host-issued remote manager-service authority for registered user-auth participants. It requires the dedicated `supervise` scope, restricts manager registration and credentials to one owner and opaque instance, and uses a lifecycle-bound prepare, activate, and renew flow with fail-closed renewal and same-owner descendant provisioning.

### Patch Changes

- b282f70: Honor a connector's declared startup readiness window and make Jcode provider launch refusals diagnosable without exposing private harness output.
- 0323f5b: The manager logged nothing when a seat left its ownership, on any path. A live
  supervisor lost several seats while it kept running, and because its log carried
  no per-seat exit line, "the supervisor reaped them" and "they died on their own"
  were indistinguishable afterwards — the incident could not be attributed from
  supervisor state at all.

  Every free path now emits one line at `freeSlot`, the single chokepoint they all
  pass through, naming the seat, its lifecycle uid, which path gave up the slot,
  and what the runtime saw when the child ended. The cause is a required argument
  with no default, so a new free path cannot compile without naming itself.

  `AgentHandle` gains an optional `exitInfo()`; the pty runtime stops discarding
  the exit code and signal node-pty already hands it. Absent means UNKNOWN and
  prints as unavailable naming the runtime — a backend that attaches to an
  externally-owned process (tmux/cmux/orca/herdr) cannot see how the child ended,
  and a default of `code 0` there would fabricate a clean exit on precisely the
  seats whose death nobody can explain.

- 196dddb: Spec text plus one corrected source comment, carried into the embedded docs bundle: the `goaleff` and `epname` value
  machines are now stated in the wire spec (phases, states, legal edges, per-phase field sets,
  actor roles, and the rule that a settle requires the goal's terminal fact to exist first),
  and three key-authority claims are corrected. `epmig` records cutover runs and supplies key
  material nowhere else, so the `goaleff` generation token is the accepted submission's EPJ
  `sourceSeq` and only that. `goalidx` gets its writer named as the goal-writer principal
  rather than the bare commit principal. `effect` is marked as reachable only under
  `protocol.v: 2`. The spec also now says explicitly that it does not decide which principal
  may act as a sweeper, rather than leaving that to be inferred from a role name. The `epmig` record
  kind's own source comment carried the same wrong claim the spec sentence corrects, and is fixed in
  the same change so the two cannot drift apart again.

## 0.29.2

### Patch Changes

- 8531c13: Reachability probes give websocket brokers a transport-sized budget. The 1s
  default was tuned for the loopback/LAN TCP brokers local probes dial; a ws(s)
  broker is by definition published through an HTTPS edge, where TLS + upgrade +
  INFO + the auth round-trip routinely exceeds 1s cold — measured as a majority
  of spawns against a Cloudflare-fronted mesh refusing with "not reachable" while
  the broker was up. `isReachable` and `probeConnect` now default to 5s when the
  server list dials over ws/wss; explicit `timeoutMs` callers are untouched.

## 0.29.1

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f025c3: `cotal spawn` works against a mesh registered from a remote bundle. A user-mode
  agent's credentials must be granted where the space's signer lives, so a laptop
  spawn previously refused with a message about missing local material. A mesh may
  now advertise an agent-provisioning endpoint in its discovery bundle
  (`cotal up --agent-provisioning-url <https://…>`, carried as
  `userAuth.endpoints.agentProvisioningUrl`); spawn POSTs the operator's login
  bearer there, lands the returned material 0600, and runs the same bearer
  preflight before launch. A remote mesh that advertises none now refuses by
  naming that fact and the operator's remedy, instead of blaming absent local
  state. The endpoint is https-only (it receives the login bearer) and redirects
  are refused, matching the registration fetch discipline.

  The login proof itself never crosses the CLI package: the provisioning POST is
  a new optional `AuthProvider.postAgentProvisioning` seam on core's provider
  interface, implemented by `@cotal-ai/auth` — the CLI keeps its no-auth-import
  boundary.

  Also fixes `finalizeUserBundleEndpoint`, which replaced the bundle's endpoints
  object and would have dropped any sibling field the composer set.

## 0.28.2

### Patch Changes

- 53f66c2: The credless liveness probe spoke plaintext NATS at ws/wss servers, reading TLS
  bytes and declaring a live broker down — which blocked `spawn` and reachability
  reads with a wrong remedy. On ws servers it now dials the websocket transport
  credless; an auth broker rejecting the bare connect still proves it is there.

## 0.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 2a383fe: ws/wss dials no longer pass a `tls` block (the URL scheme already decides TLS on the
  websocket transport, which refuses the option outright), and the standalone channel
  helpers now pick their transport by scheme instead of always dialing TCP — so
  `channels list`, `send`, and every endpoint connect work against a `wss://` broker.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 09b6a3b: Saving an agent file no longer drops a declared-empty channel policy. `subscribe`,
  `allowSubscribe` and `allowPublish` are written whenever they are set, so a file that
  declares an empty read set still says so after a save. They were previously emitted only
  when non-empty, which meant loading and saving a persona rewrote an explicit empty list
  into an absent field and lost the difference between "reads no channels" and "never said".
  Defining a persona over an existing one loads and saves its file, so that path quietly
  rewrote the stored policy of an agent whose content was being edited. An unset field is
  still written as unset.
- 86f6b10: Remove the implicit `general` channel floor: undeclared access now grants nothing

  An agent that declared no channel access used to fall back to `["general"]` for its
  active read set and read ACL. That floor was applied in seven places — the provisioner,
  the agent-file loader, the manager's spawn path, the CLI's `spawn`, the connector's
  config resolver, and the endpoint's own channel list — so an agent with no frontmatter
  silently joined a channel nobody had granted it.

  The fallback also could not see the credentials it was guessing against. On a manifest
  spawn the materialized persona carries no access frontmatter, so the connector fell back
  to `general` while the minted creds allowed only the manifest's channels; the broker then
  refused the subscription and the agent joined nothing, with no error naming the cause.
  `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE` forwarding was added to paper over exactly this.

  Undeclared read is now empty, matching the repo's no-fallbacks rule and the existing
  default-deny on `allowPublish`. `Endpoint.send()` throws instead of defaulting to
  `general` when the endpoint is on no concrete channel — a caller that never declared a
  channel now gets a loud error rather than a message delivered somewhere it never asked
  for.

  The seeded personas change with it: `default_agent` no longer auto-subscribes to
  `general` and no longer carries a wildcard post ACL (`allowPublish: [">"]` → `[]`,
  default-deny), and the demo personas move to their own `welcome` channel. Channels are
  implicit — created on first use — so no channel provisioning is required.

  Breaking for anyone relying on the implicit floor: an agent that read `general` without
  declaring it must now declare it.

- a84cb62: Saving a persona now requires it to name the channels it reads. `saveAgentFile` refuses a
  definition with no `subscribe`, `cotal personas new` takes a required `--subscribe` (pass
  an empty value for an agent reachable only by direct message and anycast), and a persona
  defined over the wire is created with an empty read set, since that path deliberately
  accepts no policy from its caller, and records that the caller was never offered the
  choice so a reader can tell it apart from a persona whose author chose no channels. Previously a saved persona with no read set inherited
  whatever default was current, so a file could grant a channel its author never chose and a
  later reader could not tell a deliberate silence from a forgotten field. An empty list is
  written rather than filled in, so the two stay distinguishable.
- 44738b2: A remotely-registered user mesh now connects with stock cotal end to end, including over a websocket broker address.

  `cotal meshes add <space> --from <url>` already landed a complete remote trust
  position (IdP pins, public exchange URL, sentinel creds); the auth provider now
  CONSUMES it at connect when no local user-auth material exists: login session →
  fresh IdP JWT → the pinned exchange's capless public face → bearer + the
  registration-landed sentinel. Nothing is discovered at connect time, the
  transport rule (HTTPS, loopback-literal http only, names get no exception) is
  checked before the IdP round trip, and every refusal names its exact remedy.

  Brokers published through an HTTPS edge are dialable as `wss://host/path`:
  core picks the websocket transport by scheme at every dial site (endpoint,
  reachability, probe), `hostPort` defaults ws/wss to the web's ports, and
  `join-target` classifies `wss://` as TLS-bearing (the handshake is the
  transport's own) while `ws://` gets exactly the plaintext fences `nats://`
  gets. The canonical server string keeps the URL path — behind an edge the
  path is part of the broker's address.

### Patch Changes

- 9216d21: Reopen the derived membership-feed KV and rearm existing membership watches after an endpoint reconnect. The feed handle and watch iterator are connection-scoped: retaining either old epoch made membership reads fail with `closed connection` or left an existing dashboard watch silently stale while the endpoint's other planes had recovered. Replaced or stopped watches delete their ordered broker consumer rather than leaving it until the inactivity threshold; terminal self-heal records the predecessor identity and deletes it through the fresh connection; caller stop is awaitable, the dashboard waits before draining, and a stop concurrent with terminal close remains endpoint-owned until fresh-epoch deletion completes, while permanent endpoint shutdown still settles if no broker recovery is possible.
- e377c7b: The manager's session signing key now renews itself instead of expiring after a day. It was minted
  once at startup with a flat 24-hour window and the same frozen anchor was returned for the life of
  the process, so any manager with more than a day of uptime lost its session plane permanently: every
  attach failed closed with "outside its validity window", and the only recovery was restarting the
  manager, which kills every live session. Failing closed on an expired key is correct and is
  unchanged; never renewing the key was the defect. The key now rotates once a third of its window has
  elapsed, the previous key stays verifiable for a ten-minute overlap so an artifact signed just
  before a swap is not orphaned, renewal is driven both by a timer and opportunistically before
  signing so a stalled timer alone cannot reintroduce the outage, and the newest key is never dropped.

## 0.27.0

## 0.26.0

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- c83e600: Let a caller hear its own goal's terminal, and say so distinctly when it cannot. `epCallerGrantRows`
  returns `{pub, sub}` and documents its `sub` as the per-goal progress row that lets a caller follow
  its own goal to terminal, but the `spawn` and `admin` mint branches took `.pub` alone, so a
  spawn-capable credential could submit a goal and not hear it: the broker refused the follow, the
  manager committed the terminal on time, and the caller reported a timeout about a goal that had
  already settled. Both branches now fold `sub` in. Independently, a subscription error in the follow
  path was discarded, which made a denied subscription indistinguishable from an empty one; it now
  surfaces at once as a distinct refusal naming the subject, stating the goal is unaffected, and
  telling the operator not to retry.

  Every subscription error is surfaced, not only the permission one: whether the subscription failed
  is knowable from the error being present, so narrowing that decision by error class would return
  every other class to the silent timeout. What does key on the class is the diagnosis. A broker
  refusal reports `permission-denied` and asks for the grant row; any other failure reports
  `unavailable`, names the class, and says plainly that changing ACLs is the wrong remedy.

- b501ec5: Parse the dashboard's history limit once, and bound the single-channel read.

  Three history routes each re-derived the same limit parse, so a value that was not a whole number
  took a different wrong path through each of them. `Number("abc")` is `NaN` and every comparison
  against `NaN` is false, so the endpoint's `limit <= 0` guard never fired and its widening history
  search could never reach either exit: the read did not return everything, it never returned, and the
  abandoned request kept consuming CPU long after its caller had gone. `Infinity` reached the same
  hole from the other end and returned a channel's entire retained history.

  The limit is now parsed in one place and a value that is not a whole number is refused with a 400
  naming what it received, so a caller's mistake is no longer reported as a server fault. The same
  holds for the channel name in the URL: an escape that cannot be percent-decoded is a caller's typo
  and is answered as a bad request rather than as the server having broken.

  For every caller that does not go through those routes, the endpoint now requires a history limit to
  be a whole number of messages it can count exactly, not merely a finite one. A page is taken with
  `slice(-limit)` and slice truncates toward zero, so any limit between zero and one became `slice(0)`
  and returned the subject's entire retained history; a magnitude past exact counting did the same. The
  check sits above the empty-page check on purpose, since `-Infinity` is less than zero and would
  otherwise be folded into a silent empty page.

  The single-channel history read now carries the same per-request deadline as the aggregate routes,
  with a named refusal, because the console view re-reads it on every poll. Zero still means zero,
  negatives still mean an empty page, and an absent or empty limit still means the route's default.

- a087c2b: A spawned agent now inherits the operator's environment. A harness you installed and configured
  should behave under `cotal spawn` the way it behaves when you run it yourself, and the alternative
  was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors: every new provider needed a change in Cotal
  before it would work through a managed spawn. `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEYS` and the per-connector lists
  that extended it are gone, and Cotal no longer names an inference vendor anywhere in its source.

  Cotal still resets its own `COTAL_*` namespace before the child starts, keeping the machine-wide
  knobs (`COTAL_HOME`, the feedback set, the default-agent pair, the `*_BIN` overrides, the timing
  knobs). That reset is not configurable, because it is identity and not preference: a connector
  supplies the per-session names for each child and does so conditionally, so an inherited value is
  never overwritten and would hand an agent another agent's credential path, ACL, or lifecycle uid.
  The whole prefix is stripped rather than a named list, because which names a connector sets varies
  between connectors and a deny-list only ever names what its author remembered.

  To confine a spawned agent instead, declare `spawn.env` in the cotal config file. The child then
  gets a fixed OS allow-list plus exactly the names you list. An empty array is a real policy meaning
  the OS allow-list alone. Note what this does and does not buy: `HOME` is forwarded either way, so
  an agent with a shell reads `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` regardless, and this protects only secrets that
  live nowhere but the environment.

- 0b602e4: Managed Pi sessions can now fork an existing Pi transcript into the mesh and recover the exact active Pi session after an unexpected process crash. The Pi adapter reports session changes through its authenticated local control endpoint and an owner-only atomic state file; the manager preserves the Cotal identity, lifecycle UID, credentials, children, and durable inbox across up to three restarts in two minutes, then retires a crash loop loudly. Deliberate stops never restart.
- 34caaf4: Agent seats no longer export their connection material into the environment every descendant
  process inherits. The broker URL, the creds path, the auth token, the user-mode identity and the
  local control token now ride a private 0600 launch-material file whose path is the only thing in the
  seat's environment; pi, codex and OpenCode drop even that path once they have read it (for OpenCode
  that happens in the `opencode serve` process its seat shim starts, which is also what runs the
  session's tool calls), while claude and hermes keep the reference because their readers are
  short-lived children that start later. A session driven by hand still sets `COTAL_CREDS` / `COTAL_SERVERS` itself, and a
  launch that carries both carriers is refused rather than resolved by precedence.
- 8e38835: Carry the manager's readiness guidance on an `uncertain` goal terminal. The manager built a
  diagnosis naming the agent and telling the operator to inspect rather than re-issue, then dropped
  it: the terminal committed core's generic "the success signal did not arrive within the readiness
  deadline", which reads as a plain failure and teaches a re-issue, and a re-issue after a launch
  that actually succeeded mints a duplicate agent. `settleGoalUncertain` now accepts an optional
  `reason` the committer supplies, and the manager passes the detail it already constructed; core's
  line remains the fallback for a committer that supplies none.
- 6959679: The dashboard survives a poll that fails, and its aggregation answers instead of failing.

  A failed poll used to clear the peers and the channels. A 500's body is valid JSON and `fetch` does
  not reject on one, so the refusal arrived as a successful parse and was stored as the snapshot. Reads
  now refuse a non-200 by name, a refused read leaves the value the page already holds exactly where it
  is, and the header says which source is stale and why. Recovery is the next successful read.

  `/api/activity` no longer fans out every channel's history at once with no upper bound, where one
  channel's rejection became the whole route's 500 and a slow link produced a 34-second success.
  Sources race one shared deadline through a bounded pool, and the page always carries `partial`, the
  counts, the named missing sources, and the deadline it used, so a short page cannot be mistaken for a
  complete one. `/api/dms` is one read with no subset to serve, so its bound is a 503 that names the
  deadline. A channel list that cannot be read is a refusal that says so rather than a page claiming
  the space is empty.

  The elevated observer/admin credential can now delete consumers on its own presence bucket. A KV
  watch rebuilds itself when the link stalls and each rebuild deletes its predecessor; without that
  grant the cleanup was refused, so orphaned consumers accumulated until their inactivity threshold and
  the broker logged a violation every time.

### Patch Changes

- 636b4b8: Name the rejected property in closed-contract validation refusals. An `additionalProperties: false` refusal printed only `/ must NOT have additional properties`; the rejected key rides AJV's `params.additionalProperty` and was dropped, so a caller/responder version skew (a newer CLI sending a key an older deployed manager's contract predates) surfaced as a guessing game. Both render sites (the invocation-time `bad-request` and the responder-side `internal`) now append the key: `/ must NOT have additional properties: "events"`.

- b7cc4fa: Host a cotal-lang run on the mesh.

  `@cotal-ai/lang` gains the durability the language rested on but did not have: run pins with a
  run clock, scope journal entries that record a race's winner and its losers so a replay resolves
  the same arm, a refusal when a resume is handed a journal without the pins that decide it, and an
  effect ceiling read from the pins rather than a default.

  `@cotal-ai/core` gains the step journal's storage plane, the run record and its lease, the
  checkpoint answer record, and the notice and migration records.

  `@cotal-ai/runtime` is new: the mesh handler that performs a program's effects on the real planes
  (durable pauses on the checkpoint plane, event awaits over durable consumers, notices), the
  `RunDriver` the manager daemon hosts, journal-replay resume, migration onto edited source, and a
  fork that redoes work under a new run id. Effects that need durable actions refuse through one
  named seam rather than pretending to succeed.

### Minor Changes

- 57d3a57: A Claude session publishes a structured event plane, and the `tr-<name>` transcript mirror is
  retired

  A session launched with `cotal spawn --events` now actually publishes. The Claude connector maps
  its session records to structured events behind the same hook relay the mirror used to sit behind:
  run boundaries per turn, assistant text, reasoning, and each tool call with its arguments, its end
  and its result, written to a per-session write-ahead log before they go on the wire so a restart
  resumes at its cursor instead of replaying or skipping. Until now no connector constructed the
  emitter at all, so every event channel was empty.

  The `tr-<name>` mirror is removed in the same change rather than deprecated alongside it. Gone with
  it: the `--transcript` and `--no-transcript` flags on `cotal spawn`, the `transcript` field on the
  manager's spawn op and its service contract, `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT` and `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT`,
  `LaunchOpts.transcript`, `Connector.transcriptChannel`, and the mirror in all three connectors that
  carried one.

  MIGRATION. If you read a `tr-<name>` channel, nothing publishes to it any more. A managed session no
  longer mirrors its prose there under any flag or environment variable, and a spawn that passes
  `--transcript` now fails on an unknown flag rather than being ignored. Read the session's event
  channel instead: launch with `--events` and subscribe to `events.<owner>.<actor>`, which is keyed on
  the session's principal. On a static mesh that is `events.local.<key>`, where the key is what the
  manager allocated and the spawn reply carries it as `id`; on a user-auth mesh it is
  `events.<your-owner>.<agent-name>`, where the actor half is the agent's own name. `connect-claude.md`
  gives both forms. `cotal console` and the web console render event frames directly. Unlike
  `tr-<name>`, you cannot simply subscribe: the plane needs an out-of-band grant, and the command for
  it is under "To let something read a plane" below.

  What you gain and what you lose, both stated. A tool call now arrives with its full arguments, its
  end and its result, in a vocabulary a program can read, where the mirror gave a truncated one-liner
  of glyph-prefixed text. What you lose is prompt text somebody else wrote: the mirror republished
  every prompt, and the event plane withholds the body of a turn the agent did not author, because
  republishing a peer's message onto a channel that peer may not read crosses an ACL boundary. A
  peer-authored turn still opens a run and still shows the work it caused. One stated limit on that,
  because the loss column is only useful if it is complete: a tool result is this session's own output
  and is republished, so peer text quoted inside one still reaches the wire. A cell in
  `agui-authorship.smoke.ts` holds that as a measured limit rather than leaving it to be discovered.

  A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is creating, and no other. A spawn that names
  a different agent's event channel in `allowSubscribe` or `allowPublish` is refused at the door,
  because that channel carries the session's tool inputs and outputs. The same rule runs on a manager
  resume: a retained inventory naming another agent's event channel is refused rather than adopted.

  The rule reads a **concrete** channel, two principal tokens and nothing else. A pattern such as
  `events.<owner>.>` is not an event channel to it and passes untouched, governed by ordinary ACL
  authority. That is deliberate, since the pattern is the form an operator writes on purpose for an
  observer.

  To let something read a plane, grant it out of band. The refusal prints one command, spelled out in
  full, for the mesh it is running on. On a user-auth mesh:
  `cotal actor grant <reader> --owner <owner> --scope '' --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --allow-publish
''`, every field named because `actor grant` is an upsert of the whole row and an omitted flag is the
  wide default (`>` read, `>` post, `spawn,role:default` scope), not "leave it alone". On a static mesh there is no
  actor ledger for `actor grant` to write to, so mint the reader instead:
  `cotal mint watcher --profile agent --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --provision`, the agent profile and
  not the observer one, since `mint` reads `--allow-subscribe` only for that profile and refuses it off
  that profile.

  `cotal mint` now REFUSES `--allow-subscribe` / `--allow-publish` off the agent profile rather than
  ignoring them. Those profiles carry a FIXED read set, the chat plane for observer and the whole
  messaging plane for admin, so
  `--profile observer --allow-subscribe <one channel>` used to exit 0, print a success line, and hand
  out a credential that reads every channel in the space: an operator asking to narrow got the
  opposite, silently. `--role` and `--provision` were already refused there for the same reason. The
  rows in `cli.md` and the sentence in `build-a-client.md` now say the same thing.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 4cf5f72: Give a session's structured event plane a way to be turned on, and a channel that names who is publishing.

  An agent can now be launched with `cotal spawn --events`, foreground or detached, which publishes
  that session's structured event stream, what it did rather than the prose it wrote, on a channel of
  its own so an external observer or UI can read it. Off by default. Nothing about an existing launch
  changes.

  **The channel is named after the principal, never the display name.** It is `events.<owner>.<actor>`,
  derived from the principal the manager actually allocated. A display name is UI convenience: this
  mesh permits two live agents to carry one, and the manager itself auto-numbers a collision, so a
  name-keyed channel would fuse two principals onto one subject and, in auth mode, would authorize both
  onto it from a value that identifies neither. The derivation is a single function on the connector
  contract, `eventChannel`, so the subject the manager grants and the subject the session publishes to
  cannot drift apart. A connector that does not implement it refuses `--events` before any provisioning
  rather than starting a session whose events have nowhere legal to land, and the refusal releases the
  name it had already reserved.

  **The flag and the grant are deliberately separate.** Holding publish rights on a channel is not a
  request to publish to it. An agent file or a manifest can hand-write anything into `allowPublish`, so
  if a grant could arm the plane, any author who could write an agent file could turn on a full
  transcript of another seat's tool inputs and outputs without ever touching the launch grammar. Only
  the launch arms the session; the grant is what makes the arming useful. `cotal_spawn`, the peer-facing
  tool, does not expose the option at all. That is the shape of the tool and not a control-plane refusal:
  the manager's spawn service op is a second door onto the same handler and still accepts the field,
  which is a pre-existing property of that door and is fenced separately.

  **The flag rides the whole launch path, including the record a restart reads.** It is on the
  foreground launch, the detached spawn payload, the manager service contract, and the resume document,
  so a manager restart brings an armed session back armed. The foreground path mints its own grant, from
  the principal it allocated, and passes the workspace root the emitter's write-ahead log needs: a
  session armed by one launch surface and not the other would be a flag that means two different
  things. A resume adopts the credential the spawn wrote rather than minting a new
  one, so what a restart can lose is the record: either the channel leaves `allowPublish`, or the
  arming flag does and the session returns holding publish rights it will never use, which reads as a
  working system with an empty panel. Both halves are now carried and both are asserted.

  **One behaviour change to state plainly.** The foreground launch now passes the mesh's root as the
  launch's workspace root, on every foreground spawn rather than only on an armed one, which is what the
  manager has always done. Two connectors already read that field and root their per-agent home at it:
  Codex, which puts its per-agent home under it, and OpenCode, which puts its database and its serve
  pidfile there. Both previously fell back to the directory the operator happened to run the command
  in. So a foreground Codex or OpenCode session moves its local state from that directory to the mesh
  root, which is where its detached counterpart has always put it. Operators who ran `cotal spawn` from
  somewhere other than the mesh root will find that session's state under the mesh root instead. The
  Claude connector reads the field only on an armed launch, and Hermes and pi do not read it at all.

  **Supporting pieces in the shared connector runtime.** The event vocabulary is exported from
  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` for the first time, so a connector can reach it by package name instead of
  by deep path. The emitter gained a way to close an open run out of band: a harness reports the end of
  a turn through a lifecycle hook that writes no record, so a record-sourced stream previously had no
  vehicle for a turn terminal. The closing frame is an ordinary frame with one exception, it republishes
  the source cursor unchanged, because advancing it would mark records consumed that were never mapped
  and leave a consumer no gap to notice it by. The emitter refuses to close while a message or a tool
  call is still open under the run, while a frame is still pending recovery, and after a halt.

  **One pre-existing limit this makes visible earlier.** In user mode the allocated actor is the display
  name, and principal tokens forbid `-`, which is reserved as the principal name form's separator. The
  manager's collision handling appends `-2`, so the second user-mode launch of any persona has never
  been principal-keyable; it already failed at the identity and provisioning sites. The event grant is
  derived before provisioning, so that launch now fails before it leaves a footprint rather than after.
  The underlying naming limit is unchanged and is not addressed here.

- 9c2412c: `cotal input --name <seat> --text <text> [--no-enter]` types one line into a running managed agent's terminal and returns, so a program can deliver a harness command (`/compact`, `/clear`, `/model`) without holding an `attach` stream open. It is backed by a new manager op `input`, which carries the same row shape and the same authorization as `attach` (capability `manager.lifecycle`, targeted, authz modes `owner` and `any`), takes `{text, enter?}` with the text verbatim up to 64KiB, and answers `{name, bytes}`. Enter is appended unless suppressed; nothing is echoed back. The manager's cluster document is revision 7, so a caller's `describe` sees the new command. `AgentHandle` gains an optional `write(data)`: the `pty` runtime implements it, and the external terminal runtimes (`tmux`, `cmux`, `orca`, `herdr`) do not own the child's input stream, so `input` refuses and names the runtime rather than dropping the keystroke. The command is granted only to operator credentials, in both modes, and NOT to the `spawn` capability that already carries `despawn` and `attach`. That placement is deliberate: an `attach` grant needs a `session-caller` credential to redeem and an agent profile cannot mint one, so `input` would be genuinely new authority rather than a restatement of `attach`, and the own-owner rule that bounds `despawn` covers every seat under an owner rather than only the ones a caller launched. Killing a peer is denial; typing into a peer is control of it. On a user-auth mesh `cotal input` therefore needs ledger scope `admin`, the scope `ps` already needs there.

### Patch Changes

- 219d33c: `cotal spawn --agent pi --prompt <text>` now delivers the prompt as Pi's initial message (its first turn) instead of silently dropping it; an empty prompt, or one starting with `-` or `@`, refuses the launch. The connector contract no longer describes an initial prompt as something a connector may ignore: a connector delivers it or throws at launch. The other connectors follow the same rule: Claude Code and Codex refuse a prompt that is empty after trimming instead of dropping it, and Hermes refuses an initial prompt outright until its first turn is wired.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 2752fe7: Stop `cotal ps` waiting on registrations whose host is gone, and give those registrations an exit.

  A class scatter's gather has two exits: every frozen slot answered, or the deadline. The expected set
  is frozen from the service registry, which records registration rather than liveness, and an instance
  that crashes never deregisters, so its record goes on claiming a live instance for as long as the
  bucket exists. That leaves a slot which can never answer, which makes the first exit unreachable, so
  the deadline is paid in full on every scatter in the space, indefinitely. Measured on the laptop this
  was built against: `cotal ps` at 12.5s with one true corpse in the set, ending in a row that read
  `unreachable` for a machine that had been gone for weeks. There was no way to remove that record.
  Three things were wrong, one per layer, and all three are fixed here.

  **The scatter can now be told an instance is gone.** `epScatter` takes an optional `probeLiveness`
  hook and ends the gather once every frozen slot has either produced a valid reply or been affirmed
  gone. It moves the classification point and nothing else: an affirmed-gone slot is still `missing`,
  still surfaced, still not `complete`, and a straggler arriving after an early finish is still reported
  `late` rather than dropped. Only the verdict `gone` licenses anything; `live`, `unknown`, a hook that
  throws, and any value outside the closed set all leave the full deadline standing, so a broken probe
  degrades to exactly the previous behaviour rather than to a fast wrong answer. `epProbeInstanceInterest`
  supplies that verdict from the broker itself: a `describe` cast on the instance's own rail with the
  reserved no-responders sentinel as its reply-to, the same primitive and trust rule `epCall` already
  relies on. A serving incarnation subscribes its instance rail for every command it serves and every
  endpoint must serve `describe`, so silence on that rail is evidence of absence rather than absence of
  evidence. The reply is never read, so an instance whose describe is broken still reads as present.

  **And a probe is never a reason to still be running.** Against a live instance the probe is never
  answered, because the request is a cast and a responder must not reply to one, so its deadline timer
  runs the full budget on every healthy instance every time. Wired into `cotal ps` that was measured at
  four extra seconds after the last row was printed, on a mesh with no dead registration in it at all:
  12.8s with the probe against 8.8s with it switched off, same tree and same mesh. The timer is now
  unref'd, so a probe still settles `unknown` at its budget for anyone waiting on it and no longer holds
  the event loop open for a caller whose gather has already finished. The same measurement after the fix
  is 8.6s to 9.4s.

  **The probe belongs to the caller, not to the scatter.** Asking about an instance is a publish on that
  instance's rail, and a credential holding no row for it is refused by the broker asynchronously while
  the publish returns normally, so a refused probe is silent and silence is what a live but slow instance
  looks like. Core cannot tell those apart because core does not know what the credential carries. So
  `epScatterService` forwards a caller-supplied hook and never invents one, and the CLI supplies a closure
  that returns `unknown` without publishing for any id outside its pinned set, and reports a refusal the
  broker raises anyway instead of letting it expire into a timeout. That refusal is attributed to the
  instance its own subject names, parsed as an exact route token, so one refusal is never charged to a
  second frozen instance whose id happens to be a prefix of the refused one. `cotal ps` freezes the class on its
  first connection, re-mints an instrument pinned to exactly the frozen ids, and resolves and scatters on
  a second. `instancePinnedInstrumentCapabilities` accepts several ids as well as one; each still emits
  its own concrete rows, so no wildcard instance is minted and the existing boundary on instance
  addressing is unchanged.

  **A registration now has an exit, in two explicit routes.** A manager that stops cleanly deletes its own
  `svc` spec and status keys, so an instance that was shut down leaves no row behind; a manager that loses
  its lease still tears down fail-closed and deliberately does not deregister, because at that point it is
  not the authority on its own record. For the host that cannot cooperate, `cotal deregister-instance
--instance <id>` removes the record, on the same evidence the scatter acts on and no weaker: it asks the
  instance first and refuses if it answers, refuses if the probe could not run at all, refuses if the
  instance is merely quiet, and deletes both keys at the revisions it read only when the broker affirms
  that nothing is subscribed on that instance's own rail. Silence is never the evidence, because a wedged
  process still holds its subscriptions and an unanswered describe is what a dead host, a hung one and a
  slow one all look like. A dead process holds no subscription, so a real corpse still deletes. Nothing
  sweeps the registry on age or on silence. Registering over a deregistration tombstone now works on both
  keys, so a deregistered instance re-registers normally on its next start, with its epoch advancing.

  **Rows split by what was actually established.** A silent instance already printed as registered with
  no answer rather than as unreachable. Now that a probe exists, the four cases behind that one sentence
  are distinguished: a registration the broker affirms is gone says the registration is stale and prints
  the command that removes it, a probe that was refused and one that was never sent each say so, because
  both are facts about the command rather than about the instance, and asked-and-silent keeps the wording
  it has, since a slow host and a wedged one are the same observation.

  **And one layer down, the same shape.** The manager writes `.cotal/manager.pid` itself rather than
  having it written by whatever spawned it, so a supervisor started by a container entrypoint, by cron, or
  by hand is recorded like a detached `cotal up` is; the record is removed on a clean stop, and only while
  it still names that process. Every reader now verifies the recorded pid is alive and is a supervisor
  before trusting it, and a live pid that belongs to something else is reported as a stale record and
  never signalled.

  This does not help against an instance that is connected but not answering. A hung responder holds its
  subscriptions and is indistinguishable from a slow one, so it still costs the full deadline, which is
  the correct result, and the removal verb refuses it for the same reason rather than unregistering a
  process that is still running. A scatter with no probe wired behaves exactly as before.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 10d9cd6: Adopt the AG-UI event vocabulary, and give a frame a wire identity a reader can recognise.

  Cotal's agent-event stream carried glyph-prefixed text, so a consumer could display it and do nothing
  else with it. The vocabulary replaces the payload: typed events with real identities, an envelope that
  carries its own ordering, and a validator a surface can execute.

  Core gains the frame's identity: the `ag-ui.frame` part kind, the event `type` discriminators, and
  `isAguiFramePart`. It lives in core rather than in a connector because every connector emits it and
  none may redefine it, which is what makes it a protocol shape rather than an adapter's choice. What
  stays out of core is producer-side: the envelope version and every event constructor.

  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` gains the vocabulary itself: the constructors, the frame envelope,
  `parseAguiFrame`, the `AguiBrackets` stream machine, and the `cotal.*` CUSTOM table, which is empty
  in v1. `parseAguiFrame` throws with the offending field named and `isAguiFramePart` never throws,
  because routing and validity are different questions: collapsing them would make a protocol skew look
  exactly like someone else's message, and a surface would show an empty pane for a stream it was
  actively failing to parse. A protocol mismatch and an unrecognised event type are both refused rather
  than partially rendered, since a skipped event is a hole in a transcript that still looks complete.

  Bracketing is a property of a writer's stream and not of a single frame, so `AguiBrackets` is fed
  frame after frame. A frame may legally open a run and not close it.

  Nothing emits yet. The channel derivation, the payload-size split and the publishing emitter are not
  in this change, and no connector constructs a frame outside a test.

  `@ag-ui/core` is an exact-pinned, types-only devDependency: it declares zod as a runtime dependency
  and connector-core is bundled into every seeded connector, so importing it at runtime would ship a
  second zod major to every customer in order to validate events Cotal constructs itself. The
  conformance suite imports the real schemas and parses every constructor's output under the schema
  that owns it, which is what keeps the hand-written literals honest.

- a1bc784: Display an agent event frame, and separate event channels from chat.

  An `ag-ui.frame` part carries no text part by design, so every surface that renders a message as
  flat text drew one as `[unrenderable part kind "ag-ui.frame"]`. A renderer now folds a frame's
  events into readable lines: streamed text and reasoning deltas accumulate into one line rather than
  one line each, a tool call reports its name, its arguments and its result, and a stream that ended
  without its terminator is flushed and marked truncated instead of being dropped. An event type this
  build does not know is named rather than skipped, because a skipped event is a hole in a transcript
  that still looks complete. It registers through the part-renderer seam, so the standard resolves it
  by the part's own kind and never learns what the vocabulary means.

  The renderer is loaded by the composition root rather than by a connector. Connectors are removable
  extensions materialized on demand, and no surface that renders imports one, so a provider that
  registered only inside a connector would be absent from every process that draws.

  The event channel's name and its classifier move into the standard, beside the frame's identity.
  Both are things a reader needs in order to recognise an agent's stream without knowing which adapter
  produced it, and the two surfaces that most need to classify cannot reach an extension package at
  all. The constructor is re-exported from its former home, so no caller changes.

  The classifier is now a derivation rather than a prefix test, and the two disagree on names a real
  mesh produces. Nothing reserves the `events.` prefix, so a channel a human created and talks on
  answered yes to "does this start with `events.`" and was swept out of the chat pane it was sent to.
  A name that does not resolve to a principal is no longer treated as machine traffic, which returns
  those channels to the view, and leaves a malformed publisher visible rather than hidden. The
  collision is narrowed rather than closed: a chat channel whose remainder is itself principal shaped
  is still indistinguishable from an agent's stream, and closing that means reserving the prefix on
  the wire.

  The console keeps event channels out of the channel strip and out of the history prefill. The order
  matters more than the result: the channel list carries one entry per retained subject, so filtering
  after the fetch would read history for every event channel and discard it, which is unbounded work
  to display nothing. Live rows are marked rather than dropped, because hiding them would delete the
  only traffic this change taught the console to draw.

  The dashboard gains the same rendering through a per-kind lookup, so its dispatcher stays ignorant
  of every kind anyone teaches it. A renderer that throws, returns a non-string, or shares a name with
  an inherited object method is reported by name instead of blanking the body. The browser cannot
  import the shared renderer, so the two implementations are held together by an executable
  equivalence check rather than by intent.

  The example harness records a message through the shared renderer instead of keeping only its text
  parts, so a message whose content is not text is no longer written to the transcript as an empty
  string and scored as an agent that said nothing.

  No connector emits a frame yet, and no transcript mirror is removed. Display lands first on purpose:
  a cutover shipped before a renderer would replace a readable mirror with a part every surface shows
  as a marker.

- a7267b3: Refuse a class-queue split before the command runs, instead of reporting it afterwards.

  An endpoint call resolves one incarnation and then invokes through a queue that may pick another.
  Until now the caller was the only party that noticed: the mismatch was detected on the reply, by
  which time the responder had already handled the request. That is why the error had to say it
  proved nothing about whether the command ran: a check that runs after the effect is a report, not
  a guard. In a multi-manager space it is how one spawn becomes several: the effect lands on A, the
  caller bound to B is told the call failed, and the retry duplicates it.

  A request now carries the incarnation the caller resolved against (`bind`, a new optional
  `EndpointRequest` field), and a responder that is not that incarnation refuses at the pre-effect
  seam, before args validation, before target resolution, and before the governed gate that can
  consume a one-use payment proof. The refusal carries `ai.cotal.ep.bind-refused` and states that
  the command did not run, so re-resolving and re-issuing is safe. `failed-precondition` when a
  different instance received it, `expired` when the same instance is at another epoch: the epoch is
  carried even on the instance rail, where the subject grammar has no token for it and a successor
  incarnation would otherwise serve its predecessor's caller.

  The block confers nothing. It can only make a responder the subject already reached refuse, so it
  narrows and never widens, and attribution still comes from the reply subject: a refusal
  attributed to the very incarnation the caller bound is incoherent and is rejected rather than
  honored, so the marker cannot be used to claim an effect away. It is refused rather than ignored
  where it has no reading: on `describe`, which is what produces a bind, and on the scatter rail,
  which addresses every incarnation by construction.

  A long-lived client recovers from the refusal instead of stranding on it. `invokeService` caches
  its resolve, and its existing split recovery keyed on a thrown marker, which a refusal, being an
  ordinary reply, never raises. It now keys on the reply too, drops the stale bind, and re-issues
  the call **once for any command**, not only for one on the repeat-safe allowlist. That allowlist
  exists because a split used to be detected after the responder had handled the request, so core
  could not tell a duplicate-able effect from a repaired one and had to fail closed; a bind refusal
  removes the uncertainty rather than working around it, so the re-issue is a first attempt.

  The allowlist still governs everything else, and that is the half that keeps this safe. A
  responder that predates the fence ignores the field and executes, so its reply proves nothing
  about whether the command ran, and re-issuing on it would duplicate the effect. The re-issue is
  therefore withheld from every reply that does not carry the refusal, and the refusal is checked
  rather than believed: the bind it was computed against must be the one this request carried, and
  the incarnation it claims to be must be the one the reply subject attributes it to. Both halves
  are derivable by the caller, and neither is something an unfenced responder can produce by
  accident. A refusal that fails either is `internal`, not a licence to try again.

  A re-issue that cannot be resolved surfaces the refusal, not the resolve. Re-resolving goes back
  to the registry, and an endpoint that has since retired answers nothing, so a stale handle used
  to be met with a describe deadline ten seconds later, with the one fact that said the command had
  not run discarded on the way. The refusal now surfaces, carrying its marker, with the resolve
  failure named as the reason the repair could not be attempted.

  That recovery is counted, and the counter is the point. Handling a split makes it invisible, and
  the routing event is the only evidence the split exists at all; silence it and the split rate
  becomes unmeasurable exactly as it becomes survivable. `CotalEndpoint.splitRecoveryCount` is
  always on and never behind a flag, and a `split-recovered` event carries the same fact for anyone
  listening; the event can be missed, the count cannot. On a live two-manager mesh, 5 of 6 unpinned
  class-anycast reads split, so this is not a rare-event counter.

  The caller-side check remains, and remains necessary: a responder that predates the fence ignores
  the field and executes, which leaves the older after-the-fact report, and the allowlist, as the
  only protection in a skewed pair. That pair is now driven directly rather than argued about, by a
  hand-rolled responder that answers the class rail without a fence; `serveEndpoint` cannot produce
  the case, because its fence refuses a mismatched bind before the handler, so a request it executes
  is one whose bind matched. `--on` still addresses a specific manager, but it is no longer what
  stands between a split and a duplicated effect.

  The suites count executions at the responder rather than publishes at the caller, and the change
  was forced. "One publish" meant "one execution" only while a split was caught after the responder
  had handled the request; under the fence the second publish carries the first execution, so the
  old instrument reports a correctly repaired call and a duplicated one identically. Where a claim
  narrowed, the cell says which condition moved it rather than being replaced.

  SPEC §13.2 and §13.3 carry the normative rules; `docs/control-surface.md` is updated.

- 5e95736: `replyRefusedBeforeEffect` no longer reads a self-contradictory reply as a refusal. The
  `bind-refused` marker asserts that the command did not run, but the detail carries no outcome of its
  own, so a reply could pair the marker with `outcome: "executed"`. The only consumer of this predicate
  re-issues a command without the repeat-safe gate, so that contradiction was being resolved by
  re-sending a command the same reply said had already run. A present outcome that disagrees with the
  marker now wins. An absent outcome is still accepted, because the spec permits omitting it and
  requiring it would stop core repairing splits for responders that do.
- 19931dd: Add the generic part-renderer seam, the principal-channel grant witness, and expecting publish.

  `PartRenderer` lets a surface draw a part kind core does not know, resolved by the part's own `kind`
  so core never learns what any of them mean. A kind with no renderer and a renderer that throws get
  different markers: a reader who meets one must not conclude the other, and neither may blank the
  message or take the surface down.

  `principalChannelWitness` / `assertPrincipalChannelGrants` catch a grant that matches no
  principal-keyed channel. Keying a channel on a principal costs one token more than the flat form it
  replaces, so an operator holding an old single-token wildcard gets a grant matching nothing, which
  at the broker is indistinguishable from a channel with no traffic. The launch reports success and
  the stream is silently mute. The mismatch is now named at grant time, and a witness subject is
  returned rather than a boolean so a refusal can show the operator a subject their grant would have
  covered.

  `multicastExpecting` / `encodedSize` publish under a subject expectation, with the envelope built in
  one place so a frame and any measurement of that frame cannot describe different messages.

  A name carrying an unpaired UTF-16 surrogate is refused: it cannot survive UTF-8 encoding, so
  distinct names would otherwise collapse into one identity.

  `assertExpectationSemantics` now states its scope correctly. The `num_replicas: 1` requirement is a
  property of the one chat stream it reads, not of the broker, and the old message read as a global
  rule. A clustered deployment runs fine so long as that stream is R1, which a cluster can host.

- 6074c26: Export the journal action rail from the package barrel, so a consumer can actually reach it.

  `endpoint-goaleff`, `endpoint-epname` and `endpoint-effects` shipped as package-private modules.
  They carry the durable action machinery the journal rail is built on: the at-most-one-launch
  election and its edge assertion, the endpoint name claim and its edge assertion, and the effect
  decision. Every sibling `endpoint-*` module is re-exported from `index.ts`; these three were not,
  so `@cotal-ai/core` did not expose the surface they exist to provide and nothing outside the
  package could import them. That was an omission rather than a decision: no consumer had asked for
  them yet, and nothing failed while none did.

  The freeze guard could not have caught it, and its green was not evidence either way. That scan
  walks exported arrays and plain objects to prove each is deep-frozen; all five of these exports are
  functions, so the scan is structurally blind to them and reports the same 18 arrays and 12
  plain-objects whether or not the modules are exported at all. A guard that cannot distinguish the
  change from its absence is silent about it, not supportive of it, and reading its pass as coverage
  is how an omission like this survives.

  So reachability is now asserted directly rather than inferred from that pass: each module's runtime
  exports must be identical, by reference, to the barrel's same-named export. This reuses the identity
  technique the suite already applies to its allow-listed re-export subpath. Dropping any one of the
  three export lines reddens that module's named cell and only that cell.

- cb9e1ad: Journal-class admission: enforce the fourth I-JSON condition, key the admission ceiling on the
  class rather than the action marker, hold decision facts to the idempotency horizon, and register
  the three coordination record kinds with their commit-path grants.

  Out-of-range numbers are now quarantined. `JSON.parse("12345678901234567890")` yields
  `12345678901234567000` and reports nothing, so a submission was admitted and its durable decision
  bound a value the caller never sent. The check reads the raw bytes, because the parse destroys the
  evidence, and its predicate is round-trip stability rather than magnitude: `0.1` is inexact in
  binary and perfectly legal, while a literal that cannot survive text to double and back is not.

  The admission ceiling is required on every journal-class command instead of only on those carrying
  the action composite. A journal-class command without the marker was accepted with no ceiling and
  refused if it declared one, though the journal rail's bind rows are derived from the class and
  never from the marker.

  `createEndpointStreams` now refuses a fact retention below the declared idempotency horizon. The
  horizon is realized by retention rather than by a clock, so a shorter age does not shorten a
  guarantee; it removes the mechanism, and a redelivered submission whose decision fact has been
  evicted is accepted as new work. The horizon is a declared option defaulting to the documented
  constant.

  `goaleff`, `epname` and `epmig` are registered record kinds, and the commit path's grant enumerates
  each at its own width. Registering a kind does not grant it, and a kind absent from that
  enumeration is denied however it is registered.

- be624af: State the effect outcome structurally when a bind refusal's re-issue cannot be resolved. The
  error's message asserted the command had not run while its `outcome` field was absent, and an
  omitted outcome must be read as `unknown` (SPEC 13.3), so the prose and the field a caller keys
  on disagreed on the one path whose purpose is to be conclusive.

### Patch Changes

- 48c6631: A bind refusal that omits `outcome`, or states `unknown`, no longer licenses an automatic
  re-issue: only an explicit `not-executed` does. Third-party responders that emit the
  bind-refused marker without the outcome field will see their splits surfaced to the caller
  rather than repaired, which is what the spec requires, since a refusal raised before dispatch is
  required to carry `not-executed` in the first place.
- ce1c248: A bind refusal is now checked for self-consistency whenever it carries the bind-refused marker,
  rather than only when it also states `not-executed`. The checks establish that the reply is an
  answer to this request from this responder, and that question does not depend on the outcome
  field, so a refusal that omitted the outcome previously skipped them and was surfaced
  unvalidated. Whether a caller may act on such a refusal is unchanged and still requires an
  explicit `not-executed`.
- 87c4130: Say what a refused publish, a goal deadline, and a class-queue split actually proved.

  A refused publish now reports itself. `nc.publish` is fire-and-forget: a caller whose credential
  does not authorize the subject gets an asynchronous answer on the _connection_, so the publish
  returns normally and the only observable is that no reply arrives. That is indistinguishable from
  an absent responder, though the two need opposite responses: mint the grant, or go find the
  responder. An instance-addressed describe made with a class-rail credential is exactly that case,
  and it read as an unresponsive manager: measured live, `ps --on <instance>` returned `no describe
reply from manager within 10000ms` against a 115ms RTT while an untargeted describe answered from
  either instance in well under a second. The describe now watches its connection for a permission
  violation on its own subject and raises `permission-denied` naming that subject, the instance rail,
  and the fact that the responder may be perfectly healthy. The watch closes its status iterator on
  every exit, so it does not leave a listener parked on the connection per resolve.

  A goal that produced no terminal in time no longer implies the goal failed. It was accepted; only
  its terminal did not arrive within the wait. Observed live: seats that reported this had already
  come up and were messaging peers, and retrying submitted a second goal that duplicated the effect.
  The message now says the deadline is on the wait rather than the work, and says not to retry on it
  alone.

  An unpinned class-queue split no longer implies the effect did not land. Describe and invoke are
  separate trips through the same anycast queue, so in a multi-instance space the instance that won
  the queue received the request and may have executed it, possibly after the error was raised. The
  core message now says so and points at `ps`/`inspect`/roster before any retry; it stops at "a call
  that addresses one instance does not split". The CLI adds `--on <instance>` as the remedy, and only
  on the commands that have the flag (`ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `spawn --detach`), which declare it to
  the shared renderer; `models`, `up` and `down` ride the same rails and split the same way, and are
  no longer told to type a flag they do not have. Absence of a pin is not evidence of the flag.

  And a split is no longer silently retried into a duplicate effect. The client recovered from
  `failed-precondition` by dropping its cached resolve and invoking again, which is a repair when the
  bound incarnation is gone but a second attempt when the error came from a different live instance
  answering the class queue: request received and answered (executed or refused; the reply does not
  say which), error raised afterwards. Re-invoking there re-issued the command automatically, while
  the error text told the operator not to retry; it is the mechanism behind one spawn producing
  several seats. The retry now happens only for commands
  whose second execution is observably indistinguishable from one: the reads and `describe`. Every
  other command surfaces the split to its caller, carrying a marker that says a responder did answer
  the request, so the caller can check before deciding. Surfacing also drops the stale bind: the
  cached resolve named an incarnation a different live instance has just answered for, and keeping it
  would send every later deliberate call on that endpoint into the same refusal, so the caller could
  verify and still never reach the live instance. Dropping it re-issues nothing; the next call is the
  caller's own.

  The same rule now covers the adjacent case, a manager restarted in the same workspace root. That
  restart keeps the logical instance id and advances its epoch, so a client that resolved before it
  gets its next answer from the same id at a later epoch: `expired`, raised after the attributed reply
  just like the split. It used to be rethrown untouched with the bind kept, so a long-lived client
  (a connector's mesh agent, the console) reached the successor on every later call, may have applied
  the effect each time, and never recovered. The stale-epoch refusal now carries the same
  responder-answered marker, the guard keys on the marker rather than the error code, and its message
  says which side is stale: a responder ahead of what the caller holds is a successor (re-resolve to
  adopt it), one behind is a superseded incarnation still answering. The old text called the caller's
  own bound epoch the responder's "current" epoch, which named the wrong side.

  That classification is an allowlist and fails closed at both levels. It is keyed by endpoint, not by
  bare command name, because the client is endpoint-agnostic and a flat list would lend the manager's
  judgement to any endpoint that happened to reuse a name; an endpoint nobody has classified has no
  repeat-safe commands, and an unlisted command is surfaced rather than repeated. `describe` is the one
  exception, and structurally so: it is served by the machinery on every endpoint and can never be
  redefined into something that mutates.

  `models` is deliberately not on that list even though it is a read command. With `{refresh: true}` it
  reaches the connector's model listing and, for OpenCode, re-fetches provider catalogs and rewrites a
  cache: the same name, in the same grant class, answering differently because of an argument the
  classification cannot see. A long-lived client invoking `models` through `invokeService` therefore
  surfaces a split rather than absorbing it in a multi-instance space; encoding per-command argument
  rules here would reintroduce exactly the fail-open shape this replaced.

  Where this table bites, precisely: it is read only by `CotalEndpoint.invokeService`, the long-lived
  client path. Its shipped callers are the connector's `cotal_*` manager tools (spawn, inspect, stop,
  despawn, purge, define-persona), `cotal spawn -f` (launch) and `cotal down -f` (despawn), whose
  splits now surface instead of being re-issued, plus the repeat-safe `ps` reads of `spawn -f`,
  `down -f` and the console, which keep absorbing them. The one-shot CLI commands (`cotal ps`,
  `cotal models`, `stop`, `attach`, `spawn --detach`) resolve fresh and invoke once on a short-lived
  connection; they had no cached bind and no retry, and are unchanged. That is the clearest statement of what the list is: a client-side
  stand-in for `effect` (SPEC 13.7), which the wire now carries and this change does not yet consult.
  The spec grew both halves after this work began: `effect` declares whether repeating a command is
  safe, and rides `protocol.v: 2`, while this tree still registers and resolves at `v: 1`, under which
  every command reads as a write. Reconciling the two is a separate change and is named here rather
  than described as absent from the wire.

  The CLI no longer prefixes every failed manager call with "no manager reachable on the ep rails".
  That verdict is stated only where the call went unanswered, as core marks it: no responder, or the
  reply deadline elapsed with nothing attributed to the request. The catalog code alone was not
  evidence of that. A manager that answers its describe with `ok:false` has the refusal rethrown under
  its own code, `unavailable` included, and a store read after an answered describe raises the same
  code; both printed as an unreachable manager while a manager was answering (reproduced live during
  review). Core now sets a detail kind on the producers that observed silence and the CLI keys on it,
  never on the code. A registry read on the caller's own side (the scatter's freeze or its reconcile)
  is a third outcome with its own line, since the managers were not the failure and may all be up. A
  refusal that states its own cause (a describe refused by the broker, a split, a stale epoch) is
  printed as it is, because the prefix contradicted it, and an unanswered `--on <instance>` names the
  instance that did not answer instead of pronouncing on the mesh (measured: three managers answering,
  one typo in `--on`, "no manager reachable"). `up`'s resume readiness poll keys on that same
  unanswered fact rather than on the message prefix.

  `ps` prints the full instance id in its multi-manager view. That view appears only where the split
  makes `--on <instance>` the one way to address a manager, and `--on` accepts nothing but the whole
  26-32 character lifecycle token, so an abbreviated header named the remedy and withheld the value
  it needed, and `--on <prefix>` was refused as a malformed token. The `stop`/`attach` seat-lookup
  miss, which lists the instances that did not answer for the same purpose, prints them whole too and
  says the id must be passed as printed. `spawn` refuses `--on` outside a detached imperative spawn: a
  foreground spawn has no manager to pin and a manifest deploy launches through the manager class
  queue, so the flag was accepted there and silently ignored. An empty `--on` (`--on ""`, an unset
  shell variable) is refused at the flag on all four commands: `ps` and the detached `spawn` carried it
  to the mint, which refused it as an invalid token, while `stop` and `attach` read it as absent and
  fell through to the seat lookup, so one input had two answers and one of them was a dropped pin.

  The peer-side manager tools stop reading silence off the catalog code too. `MeshAgent`'s manager
  invoke reported "no responder answered - a manager may be down, or this credential holds no <cmd>
  capability and the broker denied the request" for every `deadline-exceeded`, and the bare code for
  everything else. That was wrong in both directions. The broker's no-responders 503 arrives as
  `unavailable` carrying the unanswered marker, so the one case where the capability explanation is
  certain was the one case that did not get it: an agent denied a capability was told only
  "unavailable". And an answered `ok:false` describe is also `unavailable`, deliberately unmarked
  because a manager did answer -- and this surface is read by agents, where a claim of silence invites
  the retry that duplicates a spawn. Same code, opposite conditions, separated only by the marker,
  which is now what the verdict keys on.

- c038730: A manager lease renew that gets no answer no longer terminates the manager; the key is re-read
  first.

  `renewLease` treated every throw from the CAS renew as the lease being lost and fail-closed the
  whole instance: it cleared the renew timer, tore down every agent it managed, and exited. One of the
  things that throws there is a request that gets no answer within its deadline, and no answer proves
  nothing about the key. It does not prove the write failed, it does not prove the key expired, and it
  does not prove anyone else took it. The write may even have landed with only the acknowledgement
  lost, in which case the manager killed itself over a lease it had just successfully renewed, and
  took its agents with it.

  A failed renew is now a question rather than a verdict. The manager re-reads its own key, which
  separates "it is gone" from "I could not find out", and fails closed only on proof: the key is
  absent, or it is present and holds a different process. When the key is still its own the manager
  adopts whatever revision the broker actually has and keeps serving, saying so. When no answer is
  available at all the bound is time rather than attempts, because past one whole TTL without a renew
  that landed the key may have expired and been re-acquired, so the instance can no longer claim to
  hold it and stops on that ground, in those words.

  That window runs from the last write that actually restarted the key's TTL, and only such a write
  refills it. A re-read that finds the key present, still its own, and at the SAME revision is a real
  answer and the manager does keep serving on it, but it did not touch the key, so it cannot buy the
  holder more time. Reading a key is not refreshing it, and treating the two alike would let an
  instance whose writes are all being dropped serve on reads forever.

  Waiting is only safe if there is room to wait, so the renew budget gained slack. The TTL is
  unchanged and no stored config moves, but the holder now renews at a quarter of it rather than a
  half, and each attempt carries a deadline shorter than the period instead of the JetStream default,
  which was itself half the TTL. Under the old numbers exactly one attempt fitted inside the window
  and its own deadline consumed the remainder, so a single slow round trip was terminal by
  construction.

  Renews also no longer overlap. A renew whose reply is late runs past the next tick, since the
  re-read that follows it has a deadline of its own, and a second renew started there read the same
  cached revision and was refused over a sequence the first one had legitimately moved. That conflict
  was self-inflicted, and it reproduced on every attempt before the guard.

  Measured against a real manager process, with a relay between it and the broker holding back one
  direction for exactly one renew deadline: the request reaches the broker and takes effect, only the
  acknowledgement is delayed. On the old code the manager exited while its key was present, still its
  own, and carrying a revision newer than the one it was holding.

- 758e1e3: Pin `json-canonicalize` exactly, so a published install cannot resolve a broken tarball.

  `json-canonicalize@2.0.1` was published without the `bundles/` directory its own `package.json`
  `main` points at. A `^2.0.0` range therefore resolves, on any fresh install, to a package that
  cannot be imported: `cotal --version` crashes with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before printing
  anything.

  The repo never saw it. A lockfile pins 2.0.0 and CI stayed green throughout; a published package
  carries no lockfile, so npm re-resolves every range at install time and users got a version CI had
  never exercised. That gap between what CI resolves and what an install resolves is the actual
  defect this fixes.

  Both ranges are now exact, and `smoke:dep-pins` keeps them that way: it fails if either floats
  back to a range, and fails if its quarantine list stops matching any declared dependency, so a
  list that has quietly stopped applying cannot read as a list that holds.

  Stated as a limit rather than left implied: the new cell proves the range is exact, not that the
  pinned version is installable. Only installing the packed tarball against the live registry proves
  that, which is `smoke:seed-tarball:live` - and that suite sits outside `smoke:ci`, so the
  instrument that would have caught this incident exists and does not run. Wiring it into the gate
  is a separate decision about live-network tests in CI, not something this change makes quietly.

- 8572a5d: Report which bind went stale when a class-queue split is recovered, and grade the describe/invoke
  probe's forced arm on the caller-visible contract.

  `split-recovered` carried `servedBy`, the incarnation that answered, without `boundTo`, the one the
  handle thought it was addressing. A listener could therefore see that a split had been recovered but
  not which bind went stale, which is the difference between one handle to drop and a class that is
  churning. Both halves of the fact are now on the event.

  The probe's forced arm previously required the repair to land, which asserts a coin comes up heads:
  core repairs a bind refusal exactly once and lets a second refusal surface, while in a two-manager
  space roughly half of all class-queue calls split, so the re-issue goes back through the same queue
  and is split again about half the time. That second refusal is a correct and conclusive outcome, and
  grading it as a failure reddened the suite on runs where the property it exists to protect held
  completely. The arm now accepts either face: the repair landed exactly once, or it was refused again
  and stated that nothing ran.

  Accepting an absence of effects requires proving the arm could have produced one, so a positive
  control on the arming runs before any question about the outcome. The forcing writes a bind naming no
  live incarnation; the control reads it back through a fresh cache lookup, proving the entry the
  client sends from was mutated rather than a copy, and requires the first refusal to name that bind.

  Without it the ambient system supplied the signal. The probe's space splits naturally about half the
  time, so a run that forced nothing still saw a refusal, a repair, and a second refusal naming a
  different instance: every symptom of the case under test, produced by the ordinary race. Measured
  with the forcing removed, the arm passed 4 of 6 runs. With the control it is caught 6 of 6. Reading
  the first refusal's bind is what required it on the event, because once the repair re-issues, the
  error the caller ends up holding names the second refusal and not the first.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ab9b4d: Move the auth plane's retirement rail off the retired `ctl` surface onto the endpoint subjects

  The auth plane served its generic "retire a lifecycle" operation on
  `ctl.auth-admin.<owner>.<actor>`, a rail the spec retires in full and states must
  not be handled. Rows written onto a deleted rail are defects rather than
  exceptions to it, so the rail moves to
  `ep.one.auth.retire-lifecycle.handle.<target triple>.<caller triple>.<nonce>`
  instead of the cut growing a carve-out.

  Two things get stronger on the way. The reply is now derived from the parsed
  request, so there is no argument through which a caller- or payload-supplied
  reply target could arrive; and the request and reply planes are disjoint, so the
  listener credential cannot express a request subject at all. The per-despawn
  requester credential now pins both its caller triple and exactly one target
  incarnation, so a leaked requester cannot be re-aimed at another lifecycle.

  Serve-time authorization additionally requires that the serve registration a
  request names belongs to the requesting principal. The previous two-token
  subject could not express the caller beyond a recyclable alias, so the rail
  accepted any registered instance's registration. This is alias-level binding:
  the registration is keyed by an id that is stable across restarts and carries no
  lifecycle uid, so a same-principal predecessor presenting the current epoch is
  still accepted.

  The spec rows also described an authorization mechanism the implementation had
  already replaced, and now describe what ships.

  This is a subject-plane migration, not a completed endpoint migration. The rail
  carries the endpoint subjects but still exchanges the pre-v0.4 request and reply
  bodies, registers no service record, serves no `describe`, and has no contract
  artifact — so a generic endpoint client can neither discover nor invoke the
  command. That gap is tracked separately, with the acceptance test being that a
  generic client can do both. The one acceptance-path hole is closed here rather
  than deferred: the request carries an id, the reply echoes it, and a reply that
  does not echo is refused, so a wrong-id success cannot clear a retirement hold.

  The requester's grant pins its target with the `handle` mode, which is normatively
  redemption-minted. This path is not: there is no issuer-signed artifact, no
  redemption step, and no lineage — the row is built directly from the minting
  manager's coordinates under root authority. It is used because it is the only
  target mode that can pin an exact incarnation, and the serve-time handler
  re-checks that triple against the current mapping. This is a documented
  deviation, not compliant handle semantics, and it is stated at the mint site and
  in the ownership matrix row. It resolves with the same tracked work as the
  envelope, since the mode and the envelope are one wire-conformance surface.

- 208ad1f: Add a guarded way out of an issuance gate left frozen by a crashed manager restart.

  When a manager restart is killed between deregistration and the successor's completion, the
  endpoint's issuance gate is left frozen under a registration operation whose holder no longer
  exists. Failing closed there is correct — it is what stops two incarnations serving at once — but
  until now nothing could lift it, so every subsequent restart failed the same way and the only exits
  were driving the internals by hand or discarding state.

  `cotal reconcile-gate` verifies the freeze-holder is gone, logs what it found, and then completes
  the dead operation exactly as the interrupted restart would have: revoke the credential family,
  verify-evict its holders, and reopen the gate at the unchanged coordinate with the generation
  advanced by one. It is a CLI command rather than a verb on the manager endpoint because the state
  it repairs is precisely "the manager cannot complete registration" — an endpoint-served repair
  would be unreachable exactly when it is needed.

  The affirmative check required a read half that did not exist. The only principal-scoped liveness
  was fused with the KICK inside `evictPrincipal`, so using it as a precheck would have killed a live
  holder before anything could refuse on its behalf. This adds a read-only `principalLiveness`
  delivery-admin verb (observer credential only, closed query, a reply bound to the exact principal
  asked about) reporting `live` / `gone` / `unknown` with scan completeness kept separate. Its sweep
  is the strict one the plane-liveness oracle already used — full reply validation plus the
  single-server proof — now extracted and shared by both, so a probe can never be laxer than the
  repair it authorizes.

  Every refusal names its condition (`holder-alive`, `holder-unknown`, `liveness-unestablishable`,
  `not-frozen`, `wrong-op-kind`, `no-gate`, `eviction-unverified`, `raced`). A timeout is
  unknowability rather than death, the probe is a precondition on top of the barrier's own verified
  eviction rather than a replacement for it, and there is no force flag and no path that discards
  gate state.

  Two defects in the shared `$SYS` scan surface were found while proving this and are fixed here,
  because the guarded command is only as good as the observation it stands on.

  A paginated CONNZ sweep could read a **lost later page as sweep-complete**. The first page comes
  back full with more promised, the next round is silent or answers with an empty page while its own
  total still says there is more, and the loop treated that as the end of the data. Since "complete
  sweep, principal not found" is the definition of verified-gone, a connection living on the page that
  was never delivered read as absent — so verified eviction could report gone for a principal that was
  alive. Both the read-only observation and the scan/kick/re-scan primitive had the same shape, which
  also meant the two of them were not the independent checks they looked like. A sweep now tracks
  which servers still owe it a page and fails closed when one stops delivering; a sweep that genuinely
  finishes across several pages still concludes gone, so nothing wedges.

  The delivery daemon's `$SYS` sweeps were **not bound to the account it serves**. All three
  delivery-admin executors resolved their scan account from the working directory at request time, and
  the detached daemon inherits its launcher's directory for life — so a daemon started from a tree
  that resolves a different mesh root would sweep a foreign account and answer a confident, wrong
  "gone". The root is now pinned once at start, and the account read from disk is cross-checked
  against the account the daemon's own credential authenticates as.

- 4d14037: `cotal_persona`: defining a persona no longer announces on the mesh by default

  Defining a persona used to post "persona X is now available — spawn it to bring it online" on the
  definer's first concrete channel — `#general` for most personas, since nothing ever chose the
  destination: the send passed no channel, so it fell through to whichever concrete channel happened
  to be first in the caller's list. Standing up a review panel therefore put one broadcast per seat
  into every peer's inbox, and the wording read as an instruction to strangers to launch an agent they
  knew nothing about, from a principal they had no relationship with.

  `cotal_persona` and `MeshAgent.definePersona` now take an optional `announce` channel:

  - **Omitted (the default): silent.** Nothing is published.
  - **Supplied: that channel only**, never one inferred from ordering, with post rights enforced by
    the broker as for any other message and no fallback. The channel is validated before the write, so
    an empty string, a wildcard, or a name the subject layer would rewrite is refused loudly rather
    than publishing somewhere you did not name.
  - The message is now a statement of what the sender did rather than an imperative aimed at the

  - A persona whose announcement is refused is reported as **saved but not announced**, pointing at
    `allowPublish` — not as a failed definition, which named the wrong fix and invited a retry that
    posted the duplicate.

  No durable or deliberately-consultable read path is removed: `cotal personas list` / `show` read the
  catalog directly within a workspace, and `cotal_spawn` still fails loud on a name that does not
  exist. What is lost is unsolicited awareness of a bare name — real discovery, but incidental,
  incomplete (no prompt, model, or role) and invisible to anyone who joined later.

  `@cotal-ai/core` gains `isPublishPermissionDenied`, a public helper beside `isPermissionDenied` that
  is true only for a typed permission violation whose `operation` is `"publish"`. `isPermissionDenied`
  is deliberately operation-agnostic — it separates a denial from a missing service, where the
  operation is irrelevant — so it cannot answer "did this message get stored?". A JetStream publish is
  request/PubAck, and a denial on the reply-inbox _subscription_ rejects `js.publish()` while the
  stream may already hold the message. Callers that report delivery must ask the narrower question.

### Patch Changes

- f6b8b27: fix(core): reconcile presence/lease bucket TTLs at `cotal up`

  A presence or lease KV bucket created by a cotal that predated the bucket TTLs kept no `max_age` and never expired dead presence records or stale leases, so a crashed agent could linger in the roster / raw KV as live indefinitely (#286). `kvm.create(bucket, { ttl })` never updates an existing bucket, so repeat `cotal up` runs could not fix it either. `setupSpaceStreams` now reconciles the three TTL'd buckets' `max_age` via `STREAM.UPDATE` on every `cotal up` (idempotent: a bucket already at the TTL is skipped; the `duplicate_window` is lowered in the same update to satisfy `duplicate_window <= max_age`), and the `provisioner` credential is granted `STREAM.UPDATE` on exactly those three streams — nothing else. The reconcile reads the config back afterwards and throws unless `max_age` came back exactly as intended and `duplicate_window` does not exceed it — it does not verify the window came back as sent, and it does not prove expiry is enforced. That is a drift detector, not proof of enforcement, and the limit is worth stating: on the supported nats-server floor the update is applied in two places — the in-memory stream config, and the file store — and the server ignores the file store's error while answering `STREAM.INFO` from memory. A metadata-write fault (EACCES, ENOSPC) can therefore return OK, read back correctly, and leave the backing store without an expiry timer. This read-back cannot see that, because both fields it reads come from the config that did update — but it is not undetectable: the STREAMED snapshot's first `meta.inf` entry carries the file store's own config, so a store-side detector exists and was reproduced live. It is not wired in here: the snapshot scope this repo already models REJECTS these three buckets, so it would need a new exact scope or a widening of the reconcile credential to whole-body authority over liveness data — an unsettled authority question, not merely a cost one, though the cost is real too (it scales with bucket size, and a snapshot carries the bucket's records); a behavioural suite proves records actually age out on a healthy server, and the detector is recorded in the tracking issue. The remaining window is documented with its upstream mechanism in the tracking issue. `reconcileBucketTtl` is exported so that fail-closed behaviour can be driven directly against a broker that accepts an update without applying it.

  **Behaviour change worth stating plainly: `cotal up` against a mesh that is ALREADY RUNNING now performs a config write on it.** It has to — a bucket can only have drifted on a mesh that has been running since before the TTLs existed, and that is exactly the case that previously returned "already running" without reconciling anything, so the fix repaired only the deployments that never had the problem. The reconcile runs before the success line (a tick printed over an unreconciled mesh is the silent drift this removes), refuses loudly rather than continuing if it cannot complete, and reads first — a mesh already at the intended TTLs takes three reads and no writes, so a repeat `cotal up` stays a no-op. When it does change something it says so. Authed meshes mint an ephemeral `provisioner` credential for it, the same enumerated scope the create path already mints and discarded with the connection; open meshes need no credential and are not exempt, since the TTL'd buckets are not mode-gated — the fix rides `setupSpaceStreams`'s existing credential contract rather than introducing a new rule.

  **A limit of the read-first skip, corrected after review.** Where an unenforced bucket ends up depends on WHEN the metadata write failed, and an earlier draft of this note generalised from one reproduction. `writeStreamMeta` performs two writes — `meta.inf` then `meta.sum` — with no pair-level atomicity. A failure before the first commits leaves persisted state coherent and old, so a restart reveals it and the next reconcile repairs it. A failure BETWEEN the two leaves `meta.inf` new and `meta.sum` old; on restart the server logs `checksums do not match` and recovery skips the stream, so `STREAM.INFO` returns not-found and the reconcile cannot repair it. Both branches were reproduced live during review. So the worst case is an unavailable bucket, not merely an unexpired one — rarer than the first branch and more severe.

- d361951: Release the connection `probeConnect` never established.

  `probeConnect` is the one connect site whose normal case is a dial that fails — it exists to be
  pointed at addresses that may not answer. Against an address that BLACKHOLES (SYN unanswered)
  rather than REFUSES (RST) it returned its correct verdict on the deadline and then leaked the
  pending socket: one orphaned socket per probe, reclaimed only when the OS SYN timeout fired
  minutes later, so the process could not exit. A probe against a non-routable literal returned
  `unreachable` at 1006ms against a 1000ms contract and the process still had to be killed at 20s,
  while five probes left five socket fds behind and never gave them back.

  The teardown could not be added where it appeared to be missing. It is upstream:
  `@nats-io/transport-node`'s `NodeTransport.dial()` keeps its socket in a local until the handshake
  resolves, so `this.socket` is still undefined when the client's own connect timeout wins its race
  and the catch calls `transport.close()` — whose teardown is `this.socket?.destroy()`, a destroy of
  nothing. No caller option (`reconnect: false`, `timeout`) reaches the orphan, and a `finally` here
  would close a connection we never got.

  So the address is now reached on a socket we own before it is handed to `connect()`, and that
  socket is destroyed on every exit path. The gate asks only whether TCP completes, never whether
  NATS is speaking there, so a TLS-first listener still passes it and goes on to a real connect, and
  `connect()` receives the remainder of the budget its own timeout always covered. No verdict
  changes: anything past the gate had to complete a handshake for `connect()` to have gotten
  anywhere either, and both paths now share one failure classifier, so a locally provable credential
  death stays `stale-auth` instead of being downgraded to `unreachable` by a dark address.

  Operators see no behaviour change from the `cotal` binary, which force-exits at the end of a
  command and so escaped the leak. What was affected is anything embedding `probeConnect` as a
  library — including this repo's own suites, one of which had to route around the path entirely to
  stop hanging as a gate step.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 975cad1: Give each space an artifact object store, with a real size limit.

  The `artifact` message part references bytes that live outside the message; this is where they live.
  Every space now gets a JetStream Object Store alongside its other streams, created by the same setup
  that creates them and removed by the same teardown.

  It carries an explicit 4 GiB cap, which is the point rather than a detail. A fresh object store ships
  unlimited, and a space's account is provisioned with unlimited disk, so "the account limit bounds it"
  would have bounded nothing — artifacts could grow until the disk did, starving the chat and delivery
  streams sharing it. Reaching the cap refuses the write instead of evicting older objects, so a
  reference published yesterday cannot quietly stop resolving.

  A space resource has to be listed in five separate places — created, deleted, granted, enumerated for
  backup, and recreated on restore — and being in four of them is the failure that reads as correct.
  Excluding the store from backups does not mean restore skips it: restore rebuilds every excluded
  resource and then asserts each one exists, so a store left out would fail a restore rather than
  quietly come back missing. The store is excluded under its own class rather than borrowed from an
  existing one, because artifact bytes are neither transient, derived, nor a lease, and calling them
  derived would suggest something could recompute them.

  Two smokes join the gate. One proves the store against a real broker by enumerating what the broker
  actually holds — created, matching the inventory exactly, carrying its cap, and gone after teardown —
  because create and delete are claims about a broker and cannot be checked any other way. The second
  was already in the repository, asserting the stream inventory, and no script had ever run it; it is
  now registered and gated, and it fails correctly on this change.

- c76a49d: Add the `artifact` message part: a reference to bytes too large to send.

  Every Cotal message rides one NATS message under the broker's maximum payload, so moving a file
  between agents has meant pasting bytes into chat until it breaks, or sharing a filesystem path that
  stops working the moment two agents are not on the same machine. SPEC §5 reserved the answer; this
  defines it. A message can now carry `{ kind: "artifact", name, mediaType, digest, size }` — the
  content address of the bytes, and nothing about where they live, so the store behind it can change
  without any message changing shape. This is the contract only: the transport that serves the bytes
  lands separately.

  The digest is the one field that is not taken on trust. `name`, `mediaType`, and `size` are
  whatever the sender wrote, and a receiver that sizes a buffer from `size` or dispatches on
  `mediaType` has believed a stranger; `verifyRawBytes` checks fetched bytes against the digest before
  they reach a caller, which is what catches a store handing back a truncated object — otherwise
  indistinguishable from a small one.

  `artifact` is a bare core kind rather than a namespaced extension, because reverse-DNS kinds are for
  wrapping vocabularies Cotal does not own, and this is Cotal's own reserved primitive. That
  distinction has teeth: a core kind the message validator does not know is not a schema detail. The
  validator gates the durable delivery frame, so an unrecognized core part means the backstop drops
  the whole message, silently, and the loss shows up nowhere near the part that caused it. The
  `artifact` guard is enforced there, and it checks the digest's form rather than only its type — a
  malformed digest is not a reference to anything, and admitting one would turn a bad message into a
  "missing artifact" that blames the store.

  Message rendering moves to a single `partsToText` in core. The same one-line expression had been
  copied into the connector inbox, `cotal join`, and the mesh view, and each copy fell back to
  stringifying a part's `data` field — which an artifact part does not have, so all three would have
  rendered it as the literal word "undefined". One renderer means a new core part kind is legible
  everywhere at once, or nowhere, never in two surfaces out of three.

- fd361fe: Serve the broker over TLS: the transport foundation, with the omission cases made unrepresentable.

  `serverConfig` and the new `openServerConfig` take a REQUIRED `transport` discriminated union
  (`plaintext` | `tls-required { certFile, keyFile }`) instead of an optional TLS field, and
  `standaloneConnectOpts` now requires an explicit `tls` boolean with no default. Both are breaking,
  and both are deliberate: an optional transport is omitted by default, and the omitted case is the
  dangerous one. A client with no TLS requirement still connects to a TLS broker — it upgrades the
  same socket after reading the server's unauthenticated `INFO` — so nothing looks wrong until an
  on-path attacker forges an `INFO` without `tls_required` and collects the credentials that a NATS
  client sends in its `CONNECT` line.

  Also in this change:

  - `cotal up`'s open (no-auth) mode now renders a config instead of launching from bare CLI flags, so
    no path reaches a listener without naming its transport. Previously a cert/key pair given to an
    open-mode `up` would have been accepted while the broker came up in cleartext.
  - `validateTlsMaterial` checks readability, private-key mode, pair match, validity window and
    dial-host SAN before the broker starts, because `nats-server` does not: it reports an expired
    certificate valid, starts, and serves it, and only the client fails.
  - `probeServedCert` / `assertServedCertMatches` complete a real STARTTLS upgrade and read back the
    leaf actually being served, so a rotation is proved rather than assumed. Renewing files on disk
    does not reload `nats-server`.
  - A durable broker launch policy records the transport so a TLS decision survives `cotal down`, and
    refuses rather than degrading when it cannot be honoured.
  - `MeshEntry.tlsRequired` carries TLS-required client intent (never cert paths) through to
    `Connection` and `endpointAuth`, so a CLI-resolved connection inherits the recorded decision.

  `allow_non_tls` is never emitted: it is mixed mode, and a client that declines the upgrade is served
  in cleartext. `handshake_first` and `verify`/`verify_and_map` are likewise never emitted — mTLS is a
  deliberate non-goal, since identity here is JWT/NKey plus the auth callout.

  ## What this guarantees, and what it does not

  **The guarantee.** `cotal up --tls-cert <cert> --tls-key <key>` either serves TLS or refuses to
  start. There is no third outcome. The transport is decided once, above every branch in `up`, so the
  manifest (`-f`), `--detach`, refresh and restore routes cannot reach a listener without naming it;
  each route re-checks the certificate against the host clients will actually dial. A running broker
  cannot change its transport, so passing the flags to an already-running mesh is refused rather than
  answered with a success line. The decision is recorded, so a later bare `cotal up` after a
  `cotal down` keeps serving TLS instead of silently reverting to cleartext.

  **A direct `CotalEndpoint` construction still defaults to plaintext.** `EndpointOptions.tls` remains
  optional and absent still means "no TLS required". If you build an endpoint yourself rather than
  going through `cotal up` or a resolved mesh record, you must pass `tls: true`; nothing will tell you
  otherwise, and the connection will succeed either way against a TLS broker because a NATS client
  upgrades the same socket once it reads the server's `INFO`. Making that field required is a tracked
  follow-up. It is called out here because "Cotal supports TLS" is not something you should be able to
  believe while your own client is connecting without requiring it.

  **Client-side strictness is NOT complete, and the honest scope is wider than a short list.** The
  broker refuses cleartext, so none of these connects in the clear against a healthy TLS broker — a
  NATS client upgrades the same socket once it reads `tls_required`. What they lack is their own
  requirement, which is the fence against a stripped or forged `INFO`, and that is the whole reason
  this feature exists.

  Two distinct cases, and the second is worse:

  _Never had a TLS path / passes `tls: false` explicitly._ `waitForDeliveryLease`
  (`packages/core/src/lease.ts`) builds its own `connect` options rather than going through
  `standaloneConnectOpts`. The user-auth service and the membership feed connect the same way.
  The **enumerated** `standaloneConnectOpts({ … tls: false })` sites at this tip (twelve, not a
  prose list) are:

  | File                                       | Lines              | Role                                                                                                                                                              |

  | `implementations/cli/src/commands/up.ts`   | 1155, 1234         | `provePreparedRestoreListener` / `proveOrdinaryResumeListener` authenticated JetStream proof (restore + ordinary-resume adopt only — not bare `up` / bare `down`) |
  | `implementations/cli/src/commands/down.ts` | 651, 691           | `assertControlPlaneQuiesced` / `readPresenceWithoutConsumer` — **only** on `down --preserve-state`, not bare `cotal down`                                         |

  Bare `cotal down` does **not** hit those two `down.ts` sites: it stops via pidfiles
  (`stopLocalProcess`) and never opens a broker wire. Live-checked twice: `up --detach --open
--tls-cert/--tls-key` then bare `down` (with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` stripped on the down step) stops
  manager, delivery, and nats-server and leaves the port `ECONNREFUSED`. There is no silently-skipped
  safety gate on ordinary teardown.

  `down --preserve-state` is the only path that calls `assertControlPlaneQuiesced` (via
  `isReachable(mesh.server)` at `down.ts:585`, then the `tls: false` connects at :651/:691). Bare
  `isReachable(server)` is a plaintext INFO probe (`tcpInfoProbe`): on this branch's STARTTLS TLS it
  still returns **true** (INFO precedes the upgrade), so the quiescence gate is **entered**, not
  skipped, when the client trusts the CA. **Narrow residual (do not fix in this branch):**
  `down --preserve-state` **and** a CA the client does not trust — then a stricter `{tls:true}` probe
  would fail, the INFO probe still says up, and the subsequent authenticated connect without a trusted
  CA fails or the cut proceeds without a completed wire-truth lease proof depending on the failure
  mode. Same family as the private-CA diagnosis gap (S7); incomplete client fence, not an ordinary-path
  break. Flagless sites mostly **work** via auto-upgrade and are **unfenced** (no own requirement
  against a forged INFO), not "broken teardown."

  _Resolves the decision and then drops it (partially closed)._ `cotal web` now passes
  `tls: conn.tls` into its endpoint. `cotal status` carries `target.tlsRequired` on the Selected Mesh
  preflight, the open/auth live snapshot, the user-mode connection probe and user live snapshot, and
  the Recorded Meshes liveness check — a mesh recorded `tlsRequired: true` is not greened by a bare
  TCP/INFO probe against a plaintext substitute. What still drops the decision: the mesh manager
  (`startManagerDetached`'s options type has no `tls` field, so `ensureControlPlane` forwards `--tls`
  to the delivery daemon and then launches the manager without it), plus the never-had-a-path sites
  above.

  Client-side strictness landed for: `cotal up` (every route to a listener), the recorded mesh record
  (`MeshEntry.tlsRequired`), CLI-resolved connections that go through `resolveMeshTarget` /
  `endpointAuth`, `cotal status`, `cotal web`, and the delivery daemon's three dials. It has not
  landed for the manager process, the user-auth service, the membership feed, `waitForDeliveryLease`,
  or the twelve helper sites tabulated above. That table is the residual enumeration; do not collapse
  it back to prose.

  The delivery daemon is strict on all three of its dials, including the every-two-seconds reachability
  poll that re-presents its standing credential for the life of the process.

  **Also not included:** the `cotals://` handout from `up`; a rotation command; and `tls://` as a
  _server_ scheme enforcing anything (it is cosmetic at the client: nats.js connects plaintext to
  `tls://host` with empty options, and only the explicit `tls` option refuses). **Changing transport
  on a live broker is restart-only by construction:** passing `--tls-cert/--tls-key` (or dropping
  them) against an already-running mesh is refused — `cotal down`, then `cotal up` with the desired
  flags. A reload of `nats-server` is not offered, because it would leave established plaintext
  sessions alive.

  Operators using a private CA need `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, because `EndpointOptions.tls` is a boolean
  and cannot carry a CA file. The private-key permission check is POSIX-only.

  **S10 (fixed in this change):** a `tlsRequired` registry entry used to be **pruned** when a
  `connectOrExit` / `preflightOrExit` path ran without a trusted CA. `preflightTarget` probes with
  `{tls:true}`; certificate verification failure was classified as `unreachable` (prune:true), so
  `cotal send dm …` (and any other preflighted command) deleted a healthy mesh record on a recoverable
  trust error — durable state destroyed because the operator forgot `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Fix: when
  the recorded target requires TLS and the TLS probe fails as unreachable, confirm plaintext INFO
  still advertises `tls_required: true` (with a second, longer read before condemning); if it does,
  classify as `tls-trust` with **prune:false**. That proves a TLS-required NATS listener is present —
  INFO is unauthenticated and is not mesh identity — so the record is conservatively kept and the
  operator is told to fix the trust store (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`). A plaintext substitute on the same
  port does not advertise `tls_required` and still follows the normal unreachable/prune path.
  Live-checked both ways.

  **Named follow-ups (not fixed here):**

  - Defence-in-depth only: pass `mesh.tlsRequired ? {tls:true}:{}` at `down.ts:418`/`:585` and thread
    transport into `:651`/`:691` (measurement showed bare INFO already enters the preserve-state
    quiescence gate when the CA is trusted).
  - Bare `cotal down` pidfile-trust: hiding manager/delivery pidfiles while those processes still run
    lets bare down stop the broker and report success (pre-existing; filed separately).

- 2768f5b: Contract schema registration is bounded structurally, and an unrecognised keyword is now refused.

  **This refuses more than before, and it can reject a contract that registered successfully in an
  earlier version.** `compileContract` is exported from `@cotal-ai/core` in the released package, so
  this is a break against schemas already in use, not an internal tightening. The 2020-12 execution
  profile (SPEC §13.7/§13.8) now validates a schema document
  against an explicit admitted vocabulary and raises `contract-invalid` for any keyword outside it.
  JSON Schema says an unknown keyword is ignored as an annotation; this profile refuses it, because a
  profile that enforces bounds cannot soundly bound what it does not recognise — counting only known
  keywords silently skipped `dependencies`, whose legacy schema form holds subschemas the walk never
  reached. The
  admitted set covers the full 2020-12 assertion, applicator and annotation vocabulary, so
  documentation keywords (`title`, `description`, `default`, `examples`, `deprecated`, `readOnly`,
  `writeOnly`, `$comment`) and the `$`-identifiers are all accepted; a vendor extension or a keyword
  newer than this release is not, and needs a line added to the profile. If you register contract
  schemas, check them against the admitted list before upgrading.

  Everything else in this change admits more, not less. The `maxSchemaNodes` and `maxClosureNodes`
  ceilings are removed: neither candidate basis for the constant survived measurement, since compile
  cost varies by an order of magnitude across schema shapes at one node count, and the compiler crash the bound was
  meant to sit below is not a stable edge (the same document threw on a cold compile and succeeded on
  the immediate warm retry in the same process). Registration remains bounded by document and closure
  bytes, structural depth, reference-chain depth, pattern complexity, the admitted vocabulary, and the
  compile-error catch that normalises any codegen failure to `contract-invalid`.

  The §13.8 compile and validate time budgets are reported rather than enforced. No instrument on the
  supported Node floor measures the intended quantity: elapsed time counts the whole machine, and
  `process.cpuUsage()` sums every thread in the process, so background JIT threads and sibling Workers
  are attributed to the compile being measured. Enforcing them refused valid arguments on the request
  path and refused a manager's own service contract at startup.

- 019afc3: The manager control surface gains three capabilities on the v0.4 endpoint rails: spawn as an action, multi-manager instance addressing, and attach as a mesh session.

  Spawn and launch are now actions (SPEC 13.6). Asking the manager for an agent no longer blocks the caller while the process comes up: the manager accepts a spawn goal and returns the allocated identity at once (`{name, owner, actor, uid, goalId, fingerprint, executor{lifecycleUid, epoch}}`), then progress events follow the launch to a terminal outcome. Presence within the readiness window settles the goal `succeeded`, an early exit `failed`, and the window elapsing with neither is `uncertain` (a bounded, durable outcome a later `ps` settles against the live roster, never a silent hang). A persona-derived name collision auto-numbers; a hard-pinned `--name` colliding with a live agent refuses at accept, before anything is minted. The `--detach` CLI spawn, the manifest `-f` launch, and the connector's `cotal_spawn` submit and follow to the terminal, so their behavior is unchanged. The goal terminal is fenced to the executing manager's own gate epoch (the terminal lands on an epoch-scoped result subject), so a superseded incarnation's terminal is invisible to current readers; a durable reconcile index lets a restarted manager settle any goal a predecessor accepted but never terminalized. The goal-fact writer is a dedicated, family-staged, renewed credential disjoint from the serve credential.

  One space can now run more than one manager. Each manager persists a stable logical instance id across restarts and advances its process epoch when it comes back, so peers address a specific manager regardless of which process currently serves it; a restart re-registers the same instance and evicts its predecessor's serve family through a scoped, one-registration eviction credential. `cotal spawn --on <instance>` pins one instance by its exact id, an untargeted spawn rides class anycast (the acceptance records which instance took it), and `cotal ps` / `status` become a class scatter that merges every registered instance's rows with per-instance attribution and labels a non-answering instance unreachable, never omitting it. The manager lease is demoted from a per-space singleton to per-instance liveness (loss stops only that instance's serving, never the space), reconcile touches only rows the instance owns, and the retirement rail authorizes on the registration gate rather than a name-derived holder, so a deposed predecessor cannot retire a target.

  `cotal attach` no longer returns a `127.0.0.1` websocket URL. It creates a one-use, holder-bound session over the mesh: the reply carries a signed session grant (no URL, never logged), redeemed once, after which terminal bytes stream on session subjects scoped to the two parties, with backpressure surfaced as an explicit drop notice. A late attach still repaints the full screen from a replayed terminal snapshot, and close, expiry, target despawn, and manager restart are distinct, surfaced end states. The browser console is now a real mesh session client over a served bundle (the broker gains a localhost-default websocket listener), holding only a per-session, rails-only credential that expires with the session. The manager's session writer is a scoped, family-staged, renewed credential over a dedicated sessions store.

- 3539f20: `freezeExpectedSet` and `epScatterService` no longer take a KV handle.

  The freeze enumerates via `STREAM.INFO` + `subjects_filter` and reads slots via leader-served
  `STREAM.MSG.GET` — both through the JetStream manager. The KV argument was unused after the
  enumeration conversion; callers that only opened a records bucket to pass it in can drop that open.

- f85ffbf: The manager now registers itself as an ordinary v0.4 `service` endpoint (`manager`) on every static auth mesh and dual-serves its FULL typed command surface on the endpoint rails beside the existing control tiers — nothing removed yet. The served commands mirror every control op through the same handler cores: `status`, `ps`, `inspect` (per-agent read), `models`, `spawn` (the full 16-field launch surface), targeted owner-mode `despawn`/`attach`, the baseline self-mode `stop`, `define-persona`, `purge`, `launch`, the resume/preservation family, and the reserved `describe`. `ps`/`inspect`/`spawn` replies now also carry each agent's `lifecycleUid` (the coordinate a targeted request pins). Core gains the production endpoint-serve credential subsystem over the durable auth store: the §13.1 endpoint issuance gate and serve ledger (`epgate…`/`epcred…`), the registration barrier with fail-closed eviction, and the serve-mint release fence — plus a key-pinned one-shot `endpoint-serve-executor` credential profile scoped to exactly one endpoint instance's gate, serve-ledger family, and registration record keys. The manager drives its registration and every serve-credential mint and renewal through that scoped executor connection (never its standing supervisor connection), applies one shared lifecycle-membership + maintenance admission gate on both control doors (the legacy `ctl` tiers and the new endpoint rails), and renews its bounded serve credential on the standing renewal pass. Registration also publishes the manager's §13.7 contract artifacts — every command's schema root, its closure manifest, and the cluster document — to the per-space content-addressed contract store (created create-or-verify at manager start alongside the authority stores), and every agent credential's baseline now carries the store's read grant, so any caller can fetch, verify, and recompile the registered schema digests without out-of-band contract sharing.

  The control CONSUMERS now ride those rails (static-auth meshes): every CLI manager call (`spawn --detach`, `ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `models`, `down`/`up`'s resume and preservation phases) and every connector supervision tool (`cotal_spawn`/`cotal_despawn`/`cotal_persona`, self-stop, history purge) goes through the generic invoke path - describe, fetch the registered schemas from the contract store, recompile digest-verified validators, invoke - instead of hand-importing the manager's contracts; invoke currency is describe-bound (the answering incarnation's broker-authenticated identity), so a superseded or split-brain manager refuses instead of answering stale. New `cotal describe <endpoint>` and `cotal invoke <endpoint> <command>` expose the same generic surface to operators. Operator reach is now minted, not door-refined: `control-caller-privileged`/`control-caller-admin`/`deployer` instrument credentials carry tier-matched endpoint capability rows (the admin tier's cross-agent `despawn`/`attach` ride the operator-only `any` authorization mode, declared in the manager's revision-3 cluster document), the spawn capability additionally mints `define-persona` + `inspect`, and an `admin`-capability credential mirrors the full admin instrument set. Open meshes and user-mode bearers kept the legacy `ctl` path until the final slice below.

  User-mode meshes join the migration end to end: the manager registers its v0.4 service on per-user meshes too (the registration/serve machinery is operator infrastructure riding the space's static trust material), the CLI's bearer path derives its caller triple from the bearer's ledger lifecycle claim, the connector's endpoint identity is its triple in every auth mode (no ctl branch left in the connector), and `spawn -f`'s deploy probe drives `ps`/`launch` over the generic invoke path for both the static admin credential and the user-mode deployer view. Serve-side hardening: every `manager.admin`-class command (purge, launch, and the resume/preservation family) re-checks operator reach at serve time against the caller's CURRENT ledger scope on user meshes, so a revoked `admin` scope demotes the next call instead of riding out the bearer's remaining row lifetime.

  The migration is now complete: the manager's legacy `ctl` control rail is deleted. Core drops the `manager`/`self`/`admin` control tiers, the `ControlTier` type, and `controlSubject`; the server-side `ctl.delivery`/`ctl.delivery-admin`/`ctl.auth-admin` rails (the delivery daemon's and auth service's own carve-outs) are unchanged. Every credential profile is endpoint-only: agent baselines lose the `ctl.self` publish and control-reply subscribe rows, the supervisor serves no control tier, and the operator instruments carry endpoint capability rows only, so the old manager control subjects are unreachable end to end (publish rows, serve subscriptions, and handlers are all gone). The manager registers its `service` endpoint on EVERY mesh: auth meshes ride the scoped endpoint-serve executor; open meshes run the same gate/registration/serve-grant ceremony over bare one-shot connections (no credential is ever minted; the broker enforces nothing on an open mesh) and create-or-verify the authority stores at boot, so a raw broker no longer dies at the first gate write. The CLI's control layer replaces `ControlTier` with `ControlReach` (`owner`/`any`): the target's authorization mode derives from the resolved target owner (an own-domain target rides owner mode; a cross-owner target rides any mode, which the broker admits only for admin-instrument holders), open meshes ride a bare caller triple, and a raw `--creds` control caller without an endpoint caller identity refuses loud instead of falling back. `ps`/`inspect` rows pin `role` as optional (a manifest-launched agent declares none, and the reply schema previously failed the responder's own output).

- 9e13648: Static meshes now run the full §13.1 lifecycle for manager-spawned agents. Every static spawn reserves a never-reused lifecycle uid and activates a durable, principal-keyed registry head through the same shared activation saga user mode runs; a durable slot row maps the agent name to its incarnation (name reuse is serialized by the slot + the manager's hold, never by trust in the name). Despawn drives the full retirement barrier: the incarnation's ledgered credentials are revoked, its footprint is torn down inside the barrier, and the name frees only at the terminal. Manager-spawned static agent credentials are now bounded (24h TTL) and ledgered; the manager renews live agents' credentials ahead of expiry (a copied credential cannot renew and is refused at the manager's control surface once its lifecycle retires — the new live-membership gate authorizes control by the authenticated incarnation principal, never by name or credential tier alone). Crashed spawns and manager restarts reconcile from the durable registry, so no active orphan survives. `cotal up` now seeds the two authority stores on every auth mesh, and provisioning gains a key-pinned one-shot `lifecycle-executor` credential profile scoped to a single incarnation's registry keys. Unit A of the same slice makes agent secret files lifecycle-owned (`<name>.<uid>.creds`) with roster-aware name allocation, closing the despawn/respawn teardown race.
- 185e721: Renew the `$SYS` credentials without tearing the space down.

  `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are signed by
  the system-account seed, which is never persisted, so nothing re-signs them in place. The only
  repair the tooling named was "`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`", and that did nothing: `up`
  mints the pair only on the branch that _creates_ the trust record, so re-upping a provisioned space
  reused the same expired files and reported success. A long-running mesh therefore lost its
  membership feed and live connection eviction every 30 days with no supported way back.

  `cotal up --rotate-sys` is that way back. It issues a new system account under the same broker
  operator, mints both `$SYS` creds against it, and renders the broker config from the rotated record,
  so the broker it starts is the one that trusts them. The data account, the account signing key,
  every agent credential minted from it and the JetStream store are untouched; what dies is the
  retired system account, on every broker that loads the rotated config. It is refused wherever the
  on-disk material and the broker could end up on different generations: a running mesh; an open mesh,
  whether that comes from `--open` or from `broker.auth: false` in a manifest; `--restore`; an
  unfinished restore or resume attempt on the root, including one a bare `cotal up` would recover,
  since those paths can adopt a live listener and return without booting a broker; and a root hosting
  more than one space, because the system account lives in the shared broker record and the rotation is
  therefore broker-wide. `rotateSystemCreds` is exported from `@cotal-ai/workspace` and carries the
  multi-tenant guard itself rather than at the CLI flag. It is deliberately a workstation operation and
  takes no `SecretStore`: the `$SYS` pair has no store seam to be written through, and because a
  `SecretStore` cannot be enumerated, accepting one would mean a broker-wide guard that reads a local
  filesystem while enforcing nothing for the tenants actually at risk.

  A rotation requires every broker for the root to be stopped, and three checks now say so: this root's
  recorded mesh at the requested address, anything unidentified answering there (which refuses instead
  of relocating to a free port), and the root's own ownership records: a live or unreadable `nats.pid`,
  or any recorded mesh for this root still reachable. Without them a lost registry row, or a
  `nats-server` started by hand against this root's `server.conf`, was enough to bypass the running-mesh
  refusal: `up` found the port busy, picked a free one, rotated, and left the old broker serving the
  retired config while a second one ran against the same JetStream store. These are Cotal's ownership
  records rather than a scan of the process table, and the docs say so: a hand-started broker on a
  different port writes none of them and is the named residual.

  Two consequences the tooling now states rather than leaving to be discovered. The retirement is
  config-load-bound, so a stale broker still running the previous config keeps honouring the old creds
  until it is stopped. And a full backup binds to the trust chain it was taken against, which includes
  the operator JWT and the system account, so every full artifact taken before a rotation refuses to
  restore afterwards: the rotation says so as it happens, and `cotal up --restore` names the drift when
  the data account still matches. The commit is a trust-record write plus two credential writes, so an
  interrupted rotation leaves the record ahead of the creds; that split is detected rather than
  silent. One shared check compares each `$SYS` cred's issuer against the persisted record, and it
  runs on every auth-mesh boot as well as in `cotal doctor auth`, so the state cannot pass unremarked
  by a mesh that simply never runs the doctor. The boot REFUSES rather than warning: a warning becomes an unread log line
  under `--detach`'s success output, and live connection eviction rides the same credential pair, so
  booting would silently downgrade revocation to deny-new for the life of the mesh. The delivery daemon, which never
  loads the signer and so cannot read the record, compares the two creds against each other instead.

  The recovery is covered end-to-end as well as in unit form: a suite drives the packaged binary
  against a real broker, a real delivery daemon and a real manager, on a root whose `$SYS` pair is
  already past its horizon. It asserts the reported symptom (the daemon's membership feed does not
  start, and says which credential and which repair), that `down` + a plain `up` leaves both files
  byte-identical and the doctor red, and that `down` + `up --rotate-sys` clears it in the daemon that
  reported it. The survival claim is checked rather than asserted: an agent credential minted before
  the rotation still connects afterwards, the CHAT stream returns at the same sequence and count, and
  registry state written before the rotation reads back through the CLI after it.

  Diagnosis now names the cause instead of the symptom. An expired observer cred used to surface as a
  bare "Authorization Violation" in the delivery log and, one layer up, as a `membership-rw` adoption
  refused with "membership feed is not running", neither of which mentions a credential. The daemon
  checks the observer's own expiry before connecting and reports it, carries that reason into the
  adoption reply, and the manager warns on every renewal pass from the 75% point onward rather than
  letting the mesh discover the expiry at the horizon. `cotal doctor auth`, `evictPrincipal`,
  `planeConnLiveness` and the two mint errors now print the repair that works. Where the feed is down
  because its bundle is incomplete rather than expired, the daemon now names the missing files and
  distinguishes the two cases: a missing `$SYS` observer is re-minted by a rotation, while a space
  predating broker-sourced membership is missing the rw cred and the account id as well, which a
  rotation does not write, so it is told the truth rather than sent through a stop/start that cannot
  help it.

### Patch Changes

- 141c4dd: Read channel history through the delivery daemon instead of a consumer you create yourself.

  Reading scrollback used to require the reader to hold consumer-create on the chat stream. That is a
  lot of authority for a read-only surface: it is the one grant shape the protocol's mediated-reads
  rule says an untrusted holder should not have, since it addresses the stream directly rather than the
  messages you are allowed to see. A read-only dashboard or UI paid for a page of history with it.

  `readHistory` moves that read behind the delivery daemon, which already holds the trusted reader and
  the membership authority. The caller asks for a channel and gets its recent messages back; the daemon
  is the one holding the consumer. The caller cannot claim to be someone else — the daemon takes the
  principal from the authenticated request itself and ignores any identity in the payload.

  The reason this is more than a reshuffle is when authorization is checked. A consumer decides what
  you may read at the moment it is created and then keeps serving you, so revoking someone's access
  mid-scroll does not stop the pages already flowing. The daemon re-reads the caller's permissions from
  the durable registry on every single call, so a revocation stops the very next read.

  A page is the newest N messages, with a flag saying whether older history remains behind it, because
  "there is more above this" and "this is the beginning of the conversation" are different answers and
  a UI that cannot tell them apart will render the first as the second. Asking for a channel you may
  not read fails loudly, and so does a read that could not complete; neither comes back as an empty
  page, which would look exactly like a channel nobody has posted to.

  This is additive. Nothing is removed and no existing caller changes: reading history the previous way
  still works, and moving to the mediated path is a separate migration. Chat channels only.

  Authorization is the live registry row intersected with the mint-time ceiling. Revoking access
  (narrowing the live row) stops the very next page. Widening the registry without re-minting the
  caller's credential does not grant history the broker would still deny — the ceiling only rises
  when the credential does.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 498055c: Stop paying one network round trip per record, and return the recent messages history claimed to return.

  Several read paths issued one sequential round trip per record, which is invisible against a loopback
  broker and ruinous on any ordinary cross-continent link. Measured against a mesh at 534ms RTT with
  healthy uplinks at both ends, reading the membership feed took 30 to 34 seconds for 89 entries; it
  now takes under a second for 93.

  - `liveKvEntries` is the one sanctioned full-bucket KV read: a single pass whose request count is
    independent of record count, which collapses by greatest revision with tombstones so a deleted key
    cannot resurrect, and which binds its own consumer so that an empty result is PROVEN by the
    bind-time pending count rather than inferred from silence. A pass that is cut short raises rather
    than returning what arrived. That distinction is load-bearing on the ACL path: read this way, a
    dropped link mid-scan would otherwise report a provisioned principal as having no ACL row, and a
    durable join would be refused as "not provisioned" instead of as "could not read". The membership
    feed, the members and channel registries, and the ACL alias enumeration all read through it. No
    change to broker authority: the same ordered push consumer over the same subject.
  - `channelHistory` and `dmHistory` returned the OLDEST messages on any channel holding more than the
    requested limit, while being documented as recent and rendered everywhere as the latest. They now
    return the newest, read through a bounded window rather than by draining the backlog.
  - `cotal status` started the Claude CLI twice for data one listing contains.

  Two optimisations were attempted and REVERTED during review, and are not part of this change: the
  dashboard's activity feed still fetches a full page per channel (the cheaper version dropped
  genuinely-newer messages, because saturation counts messages rather than recency), and control
  commands still open a probe connection before the real one (skipping it flattened typed auth
  failures and lost the probe's deadline).

  This is the read-path half of the work. The registry-safety half — a failed network probe must not
  delete a mesh record — is a separate change on top of the `origin`/`pruneMesh` model from
  `cotal meshes add`.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f89560a: New Codex connector (`--agent codex`): an OpenAI Codex session as a full lateral mesh peer, in Codex's own TUI. A host-mode peer drives a `codex app-server` thread over JSON-RPC: inbound batches wake a real turn, and directed messages steer INTO a live turn mid-flight.

  `cotal spawn --agent codex` opens Codex's own TUI. The app-server runs as a loopback websocket listener guarded by a per-incarnation capability token (0600, inside the agent's private home), and the TUI attaches to the very thread the mesh drives, so mesh turns render as they happen and anything you type is a real user turn on that same thread. With no terminal (piped output, CI, a smoke) the host stays headless with an activity feed instead; `COTAL_CODEX_TUI=1|0` picks the mode explicitly when the tty check would guess wrong. Once Codex owns the terminal the host's own log moves to `host.log` in the agent's private home, and the handoff line names that path so a later failure is findable.

  The shared `cotal_*` tools are served by the host process itself over a bearer-authenticated loopback MCP endpoint, with the token passed to codex by env var name so it never reaches the process table. Because the app-server is the MCP client, the same tools work on a mesh-driven turn and on one typed into the TUI; the connector's own tools are pre-approved so an unattended agent never stalls on an approval prompt nobody is watching, and `mcp_servers.cotal.*` is reserved and refused rather than silently overridden.

  Autonomy defaults suit an agent woken by peer messages when nobody is watching: `approval_policy=never` (never ask before running a command, not refuse), `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, and `sandbox_workspace_write={network_access=true}`. Network is on because Codex's own workspace-write default has it off, which breaks installing a dependency or pushing a branch with an error that reads like the task is impossible rather than the sandbox refusing; filesystem containment is kept, because a peer's message is a remote input that can make the agent run commands. The network default is applied only where the sandbox is actually `workspace-write`, so tightening the mode does not leave a network grant in the launch. All three are overridable per spawn with `--opt` (including `sandbox_mode=danger-full-access` for no sandbox at all), while an interactive `approval_policy` is refused loud rather than auto-answered on the operator's behalf.

  The guide states the sandbox's guarantee literally: it blocks out-of-workspace local filesystem writes, and does not block reads, exfiltration, or networked side effects. With the network on, a peer-driven turn can read broadly and send what it reads, reach loopback and link-local services, and act through any credential it can read, including irreversibly, via a force-push or an API delete. Containing filesystem writes is not the same as containing damage, and the docs say so rather than implying the residual is disclosure-only. The offline, tighter-mode, and separate-OS-user mitigations are named in both the autonomy section and Limits.

  At-least-once delivery with exact-id acks on turn completion: a failed turn retries with backoff, an interrupt redelivers, and an app-server crash restarts the child in place on the same mesh lifecycle and re-drives the un-acked batch (a crash loop is fatal, never an endless respawn). Presence from the event stream, an opt-in transcript mirror, model catalog + reasoning-effort variants (`cotal models --agent codex`, `--variant`), `--opt` passthrough to codex `-c` config overrides, and a private per-agent `CODEX_HOME` (operator config/hooks/MCP servers never load; auth.json symlinked; trust writes never touch the operator's config). Unwired options fail loud: `--resume` (a resumed codex thread comes up without its configured MCP servers, so the agent would be mute on the mesh) and tool-sharing.

  Also fixes the seed reconciler, which treated a generation match alone as up-to-date: a built-in connector added at an unchanged generation would never seed on an already-installed workstation (`--agent codex` reporting no connector installed). Both fast paths now also require every `SEED_BUILTINS` entry to be present in the ever-seeded set.

  A connector can now declare `launchHint`, the one line a foreground `cotal spawn` prints about what to expect next. That text used to be hard-coded to Claude Code's first-run gate for every agent type, telling operators of other harnesses to press Enter at a prompt that never appears.

  The web dashboard gains Codex branding (the OpenAI mark, from Simple Icons), so a codex agent renders with an icon and a label instead of a blank badge. That map was hand-maintained with nothing tying it to the connector set, so it is now covered by a test: every official connector must have a complete entry, and a new connector cannot ship icon-less with a green suite again.

- 84f6200: Per-agent `prompt:` in the mesh manifest — a kickoff message auto-submitted once the session is up, the declarative form of `cotal spawn --prompt`.

Imperative `--prompt` alongside a manifest launch is still rejected (one source). `topology view` marks agents that carry one.

- 02b3243: feat(secret-store): move SpaceAuth (the signing authority) behind the SecretStore seam

  The space trust bundle (`.cotal/auth/auth.json`) is the last and highest-blast-radius durable secret kind. It now flows through the pluggable `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition injects its own KMS/Vault store and no signing seed lands on the hosted disk.

  - New `@cotal-ai/workspace` API: `getSpaceAuth(store, expectedSpace?)`, `putSpaceAuth(store, auth)`, `deleteSpaceAuth(store)`, and `SPACE_AUTH_KEY` (`auth/auth.json`), byte-for-byte the current local path under `workspaceSecretStore`. `getSpaceAuth` validates via the new `@cotal-ai/core` `validateSpaceAuthForRead`, which accepts both a full trust bundle (fully chain-validated) and a stripped signer projection (the `mint --signer`/container form — account keys validated structurally), and never echoes stored seeds/JWTs/space labels in errors. `putSpaceAuth` is the single `sys.signingSeed` strip site.
  - `remintDaemonCreds(root, expectedSpace, store?, { preflight? })` reads the signer through the same resolved store as the daemon cred; `expectedSpace` is required and validated against it. It never overwrites the last-good daemon cred with an unproven one: proof is a broker `preflight` (the manager's live probe, which gates every candidate when supplied) OR authority continuity (the candidate is signed by the same account key as the current broker-accepted cred — what the offline `doctor auth --fix` relies on). A same-label alternate account (full or stripped) is neither, so it is refused rather than clobbering the last-good.
  - The manager reads its signer from the injected `ManagerOptions.secretStore` (`getSpaceAuth(this.secrets, this.space)`); `up`, `mint`, `backup`, `restore`, `doctor`, `spawn`, and the delivery dev-mint helper go through the store. `loadSpaceAuth` remains the sync FS reader for name-only/presence callers and the static-auth single-machine mint composition.
  - `cotal clean all` deletes `auth/auth.json` through the store as its absolute-last step, so a partial-failure reset re-runs against the correct space.

  Closes "no signing seed at rest on a hosted disk"; the remaining hosted gap is signer isolation (the seed is still decrypted in-process at the manager's uid), not custody.

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- c3afdaa: fix(renewal): prove the broker accepted a re-signed daemon credential before reporting it adopted

  `cotal doctor auth` could report a renewal "adopted" that the broker never accepted (a false green). The daemon's credential-reload path now proves acceptance on a disposable preflight connection before it adopts, and the record + `doctor` verdict only ever claim what was proven:

  - The delivery-admin `reloadCreds` reply narrows to `brokerAccepted` (identity/iat/exp actually accepted) plus a best-effort `residentSwap`, never an unwitnessed "adopted".
  - The passive 75% renewal timer and the explicit reload share one single-flight transaction and both preflight before installing a candidate, so a rejected credential in the store can never strand the live connection.
  - The whole daemon-side transaction is deadline-bounded (under the manager's request bound) with a late-commit fence, so a hung store fails loud instead of a silent "no responder".
  - `cotal doctor auth` now exits non-zero and says so when the last renewal was refused by the broker, instead of letting cred-file health alone stand as healthy.
  - The ephemeral generation fingerprint used to bind the expected generation is redacted at the persistence boundary, so it never lands in `.cotal/renewal.json` or logs.

- 2ed747d: feat(secret-store): migrate the membership feed's rw credential onto the store seam with proven standing renewal

  The broker-sourced graph feed's data-account (rw) credential now moves as a full read/write/delete kind through the `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition can renew it end-to-end (KMS/Vault) the way `delivery.creds` already does. Local `cotal up` is byte-for-byte unchanged (the default is the workstation FS store).

  - The feed's rw connection adopts credentials the way the endpoint does: an async source read outside the (synchronous) authenticator, a preflight-proven cache, a 75%-of-lifetime renewal timer, and a single-flight transaction bounded by an absolute deadline. Its authenticator now only ever presents the last **broker-proven** credential, so an incidental reconnect can no longer present an unproven or broker-refused generation and strand the feed.
  - The renewal owner (the manager) and the daemon now share one `SecretStore`: `Manager` takes an optional `secretStore` (defaulting to the workstation FS store) that feeds `remintDaemonCreds` and every per-agent secret kind, and `startMembership` reads the rw credential through the injected store. A hosted composition that hands the manager and the delivery daemon the same store renews both daemon kinds without a restart.
  - `cotal up` writes, and `cotal clean all` deletes, `membership-rw.creds` through the seam (never a raw filesystem write/remove), matching the `delivery.creds` discipline.
  - `credsRenewalDelayMs` (the 75% renew-early convention) is shared from `identity` so the endpoint and the feed compute it identically.

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e0e641: Add the pluggable `SecretStore` seam (core `get`/`put`/`delete` contract + filesystem default) and route the durable hosted secret kinds through it: the delivery daemon creds and the auth store's callout account, issuer keys, owner secret, and service-key projection. Local `cotal up` is unchanged (the workspace `.cotal`-rooted filesystem store lands byte-for-byte on the existing paths); a hosted composition injects its own backend via `runAuthService`/`runDelivery`. `AuthProvider` methods now take a caller-composed `store`, and the new required `deprovisionSecrets` plus `clean all`'s seam-first ordering make a full local reset safe against split authority.

### Patch Changes

- be66729: Add offline full-space and registry-only backup, preservation cuts, authenticated operation-isolated
  restore, conservative checkpoint recreation, same-principal resume, and explicit fallback cleanup.
  Remove the incomplete channel export surface.
- 47d2584: Foreground `cotal spawn` now provisions the full durable footprint (read-ACL row included), so a foreground agent gets the delivery daemon's durable backstop instead of silently running live-only and permanently losing every channel message posted while its connection blips. `--live-only` restores the old behavior explicitly. A foreground exit now also retires the agent's creds and broker footprint, mirroring the manager's despawn.

## 0.11.6

## 0.11.5

## 0.11.4

### Patch Changes

- 1935221: Ship the built-in agent connectors (claude, opencode, hermes, pi) as removable `cotal ext` plugins. They are seeded on first run through the same `ext add` path a third party uses, resolved lazily per spawn, and deletable with `cotal ext remove`; they are no longer hardcoded imports or dependencies of `cotal-ai`.
- 5634ae4: Keep quiet-channel ambient traffic pull-only across every connector.

## 0.11.3

## 0.11.2

## 0.11.1

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- e3a53e3: Add a connector-agnostic model/variant selector: the `cotal models` command, a `--variant` flag on spawn, and the core `listModels` / `ModelCatalog` + `LaunchOpts.variant` contract. OpenCode discovers its models and variants from the installed CLI; Claude and Hermes reject variants (fail loud) and set `COTAL_MODEL` when a model is given.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c40280: Release the 0.10 line with the onboarding and local-stack work since 0.9.1:

  - Rework the CLI around dispatcher-parsed commands, operator-installed extensions (`cotal ext`), and extension-packaged web/demo surfaces.
  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 14510c3: Manager detached-launch hardening (#159 Part B). A detached launch now reports
  `started` only when the agent actually joins the mesh (presence-based readiness);
  a dead-on-arrival launch surfaces as a failure with its tail output instead of a
  false success, and a launch that neither joins nor exits within the backstop is
  reported as uncertain rather than assumed up. On exit — despawn, crash, shutdown,
  or lease loss — the manager deprovisions the agent's minted broker footprint (its
  `dm_`/`dlv_` durables and ACL row) through a new target-pinned, least-privilege
  `deprovisioner` profile, so exited agents no longer leave durable litter behind.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- a10ed79: OpenCode connector: mirror each agent's session transcript to its per-agent `tr-<name>` channel, event-driven from the plugin's in-process bus events (`message.updated` / `message.part.updated` / `session.idle`) — parity with the Claude connector, with no per-turn session refetch. The `tr-<name>` channel convention is exposed through the `Connector` contract (`Connector.transcriptChannel`) so the manager can grant the agent's publish ACL without the channel literal living in `@cotal-ai/core`, and the manager forwards control-plane `capabilities` (`COTAL_CAPABILITIES`) so a manifest-spawned agent exposes the `cotal_spawn` / `cotal_persona` tools its creds already authorize. Adds an end-to-end smoke for the mirror (`smoke:opencode-transcript`).

## 0.8.2

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 15fb826: Make credential-less `isReachable` a silent plaintext TCP+`INFO` liveness probe so it no longer logs a broker `authentication error` on every check (e.g. every `cotal supervise` start and registry prune sweep against an auth broker). It reads the server's unprompted pre-auth `INFO` greeting over a plain socket and closes before authenticating, so a live broker (open or auth) reports reachable with no auth-error/auth-timeout log line. The boolean result is unchanged for every caller; only the mechanism changes. `pruneStaleMeshes` uses the same silent probe; `probeConnect` and the with-creds `auth-required` classification are untouched. Limitation: the credless probe is plaintext-only — it returns false for a TLS-first (`handshake_first`) listener; the creds path stays a real authenticated connect.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 58f2d41: Self-serve channel join + durable backstop (SPEC v0.3 delivery rebuild)

  Agents whose read ACL allows a channel now join/leave its **live** feed themselves over a native NATS core subscription — manager-free, broker-enforced by `sub.allow` (join = subscribe, leave = unsubscribe). A manager-hosted **Plane-3 durable backstop** (a privileged fan-out writer → a trusted reader that re-authorizes every entry against the current read ACL and membership interval → a per-member DELIVER durable the agent acks natively, SPEC §8) ensures a post still reaches a busy or offline agent on its next turn. Channel membership moves to a privileged cursored KV registry (`cotal_members_<space>`), and channels carry explicit `live`/`durable` delivery classes (default `durable`; a space with no manager is live-only).

  The legacy per-instance `chat_<id>` live-tail durable and the mediated filter-move are removed — one clean model with no coexistence code. This is a wire-protocol change (SPEC bumped to v0.3): new and old clients do not interoperate on channel delivery.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 878f406: Broker-enforced channel read ACLs, self-healing connections, and control-plane primitives

  - **Channel read ACLs.** Splits the overloaded agent-file `channels` / `publish` fields into
    three explicit concepts: `subscribe` (active read set), `allowSubscribe` (read ACL), and
    `allowPublish` (post ACL, default-deny), with the invariant `subscribe ⊆ allowSubscribe`
    enforced fail-loud at load and provision. The chat read/write boundary is now genuinely
    server-enforced (like DM/TASK): bind-only live-tail durables so an agent cannot widen its own
    filter, name-scoped history reads, per-channel read grants pinned to the request subject, and
    default-deny publish. A follow-up review closed an ACL token-aliasing hole (a policy channel
    must be a NATS-safe token) and dropped unused DM/TASK `STREAM.INFO` grants so subject metadata
    no longer leaks across peers.
    **Breaking:** the loader rejects the old `channels` / `publish` field names rather than
    silently dropping scope — migrate agent files and personas to `subscribe` / `allowSubscribe` /
    `allowPublish`. SPEC and docs are updated in the same change.
  - **Self-healing mesh connection.** The endpoint rebuilds itself on a terminal NATS close —
    unacked messages redeliver on the rebound durables, so nothing is lost across the gap — plus a
    manual `CotalEndpoint.reconnect()` (serialized against the supervisor and retry loop, with an
    interruptible backoff) and a new endpoint `connection` event.
  - **Control-plane subjects.** Adds the self-service / privileged / admin control-subject tiers
    and threads authenticated `req.from.id` through control handlers.
  - **Fixes.** Wildcard channel subscriptions now work (`c` + `c.>`); peer-name resolution is
    deterministic and fail-loud.

## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- b3a790e: Grant `$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE` on the CHAT, channel-registry KV, and DM streams in the minted agent/observer/admin permissions, so ephemeral consumers can be torn down under scoped creds.
- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).

## 0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 18c271f: Publish all packages: configure GitHub Actions changesets workflow with npm OIDC trusted publishing.
