# @cotal-ai/manager

## 0.69.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c01391: The manager carries an agent's MCP server selection as a list instead of the `--share-tools` flag string. The CLI parses `--share-tools` once and sends the list, so the `spawn` operation's `shareTools` input is now an array of server names and the manager cluster document moves to revision 22. A `supervise --roster` entry's `share-tools:` list is used as written, so a declared server named `none`, or one whose name contains a comma, now loads and is shared instead of refusing the roster. Preserved-state inventories are written as `cotal-manager-resume/v2`; a v1 inventory from an earlier release still resumes.

### Patch Changes

- 6295b1a: `startAgent` documents its `provisioned` rollback variable once. The older three-line comment above it described only the static footprint and repeated the paragraph that follows, which also covers the user-mode grant and the custody reference. No behavior changes.
- 189cb2a: The manager's delivery-admin evictor, family evictor and freeze-holder liveness probe now open their one-call connections through one helper, `withScopedEndpoint`, which mints the 60 second credential and builds the endpoint that never joins presence, consumes or watches a channel. Before, four call sites spelled out that lifecycle by hand, so a copy that dropped its explicit lifetime would have minted an `observer` credential with no expiry and still typechecked. Shipped behaviour is unchanged.
- b9d2902: The manager now decides whether a durable static slot row belongs to a sibling manager instance through one shared rule. `inspect`, `slots`, startup reconcile, the boot sweep and the resume orphan check each spelled that rule inline, so a change at one site could make them disagree about which instance owns a row while the boot sweep terminalizes the rows it believes are its own. Behavior is unchanged.
- 8e16774: The manager now runs its event-plane and static `endpointCapabilities` spawn refusals before it allocates the agent's name, and reserves the name right before the step whose cleanup releases it. Each of those refusals, and the user-mode provisioning error, used to give the reserved name back by hand, so a refusal added there that forgot the release would silently cost the next spawn of that persona its name. When a hard-pinned `--name` collision and one of these refusals both apply, the spawn now reports the event-plane or capability refusal.
- 0b47df3: The manager's teardown chain (`trackDeprovision`, `deprovision`, `driveDeprovision`) and `startAgent`'s spawn-rollback value now share one named `TeardownTarget` type in place of four inline copies of the same object shape. A field the chain needs is declared once, so a copy can no longer fall behind unnoticed when a hop passes the value on as a variable. No behavior changes.
- adab793: Resolve an agent's read list through one core function, `resolveReadAcl`, at every site: the persona loader, the session config, the manager launch, foreground `cotal spawn` and its user-mode grant, `cotal mint` and the manifest persona merge. An explicit empty `allowSubscribe` now reads `subscribe` everywhere, as an omitted one does. Before, the session refused a persona the loader had accepted. The manager also granted and recorded an empty read list while the provisioner recorded `subscribe`.
- 561232d: `remoteManagerClient.remoteRunHosting` builds the four signerless run callbacks (`admitRun`, `issueAttempt`, `issueOperator`, `renewRun`) from a manager's registration and a caller-supplied transport. `cotal supervise` and the remote continuity suites now both use it. The suites used to spell the four run requests a second time, so a change to the shipped requests could not fail them. Behavior is unchanged.
- 98d2b41: Resolve a spawn's harness through one shared rule. Foreground `cotal spawn`, the detached `--resume` carry and the manager's `start` now all call `resolveAgentType` in `@cotal-ai/workspace` (`--agent`, then the persona's `agent:` pin, then a detached caller's default, then `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT`, then the product default). The foreground path no longer spells the product default as its own literal, so it can no longer pick a different harness than a detached spawn of the same persona. Behavior is unchanged while the product default stays `claude`.
- 6540a32: The architecture and control-surface pages, which ship in the bundled docs, and several source comments described spawn auto-numbering as `reviewer-2`. They now spell the series with `_` (`reviewer_2`, `reviewer_3`), the separator the manager and `cotal spawn` use. The control-surface spawn accept example shows `reviewer_2` as both the allocated name and the user-mode actor. No behavior changes.

## 0.68.0

### Minor Changes

- 6141e7b: The issuing host no longer signs an answering run operator for a checkpoint token a participant manager names. The manager's request now names the run and step it answers (`operator.answers: { runId, stepKey, amend? }`), and the host requires that run admitted on the manager's instance, reads the pause's token off the run's journal under a read it mints for that run, and requires a served answer to name the same run and step as the request it observed. Before, a manager could be issued the answer and settle writes for another instance's waiting pause. The pause lookups `openCheckpointToken`, `settledPauseToken`, `stepPauseToken`, `CheckpointNotOpen` and `CheckpointNotAmendable` move to `@cotal-ai/lang`; `@cotal-ai/runtime` still exports the first four. A participant manager and its issuing host must upgrade together.

### Patch Changes

- 218006f: A bearer command that fails without printing a sentence of its own now reports its cause. The agent auth preflight in `cotal spawn` and in the manager, and a running agent's bearer refresh, reported such a failure with Node's `Command failed` line, which repeated the whole bearer argv (exchange URL or state dir, space, owner, actor, token file and health file) and never said whether the child timed out, was killed or exited. The error now says the bearer command timed out after its limit, was killed by a named signal, or exited with a named code and printed nothing. A failure the command explains on stderr is still reported with that sentence. `bearerCommandFailure` in `@cotal-ai/core` builds the error.
- 681c5b0: A supervised Claude seat whose directory the manager host's own Claude does not trust is now refused before it launches, with an error that names the directory and Claude's workspace-trust dialog. Claude opens such a directory on that dialog, whose default answer exits, so the seat used to die on launch with only `EntertoconfirmEsctocancel` as its last output. Trust is read as Claude reads it: a parent directory's trust counts up to the root of the directory's own Git repository, and a linked worktree shares its main checkout's trust. The manager passes the seat's directory to the connector as the new `LaunchOpts.cwd`, so a spawn, a supervised restart and a preserved-seat resume are all checked. A foreground `cotal spawn` still shows the dialog in the operator's terminal. A carried resume uses the same check.
- 52290f4: A spawn refused by a connector's `buildLaunch` or the runtime's spawn now reports what was thrown. A connector that threw `null` or `undefined` used to make the manager reply with its own `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'message')`, a thrown string ended as the generic `spawn failed after accept`, and an object whose `message` is a Symbol left the accepted goal with no terminal. The local user-mode auth preflight refused the same way when the auth provider or the secret store rejected with such a value. Each refusal now carries the thrown value as text, or `an unreadable rejection` when the value cannot be read.
- 58dde48: A seat resumed after `cotal down --preserve-state` now takes the same harness and capability checks as a spawned seat. Resume used to look its harness up on PATH again and launched without the binary paths the manager resolved at boot, so a harness installed after boot was refused by spawn and launched by resume, and a harness removed after boot was launched by spawn and refused by resume. Both paths now launch from the boot-resolved paths and refuse a connector whose boot row is unavailable with the recorded reason. The variant, prompt and exact-continuity refusals are one check that both paths share.
- 2638235: A static retirement interrupted after its lifecycle audit was written now completes when a later manager process retries it. The retry compared the stored audit against its own manager process uid and broker eviction counts, so every process after the first, and any retry that found the connections already kicked, failed with `records different evidence` and left the slot `terminalizing`. The comparison now keys on the stable retirement identity: the principal, alias, lifecycle uid, manager instance and retirement op. The pty reaper also treats a custody record from an earlier boot as a seat that is gone. It used to refuse such a record, which held the name after a reboot on every attempt; it now removes the record without signalling anything, since no process outlives a reboot, and `cotal seats` reports it as `childless`.
- 61025a8: The roster file that `cotal supervise --roster` reads is now documented in `docs/define-a-team.md` under "Roster files", which lists every key an entry takes: `name`, `agent`, `role`, `config`, `cwd` and `share-tools`. `docs/deploy.md` and the `--roster` row in `docs/cli.md` point there. The roster template and the deploy README no longer say an entry maps to the removed `cotal start`; they say each entry starts one agent the way `cotal spawn --detach` does and point at the docs section instead of keeping their own key lists. No behavior changes.
- 1820d96: A user-mode spawn that fails after its grant is written now rolls back every step and says what it left behind. The rollback ignored a failed grant revoke and failed secret deletes, and a credential file that could not be removed (for example a directory at the health path) aborted it before the broker teardown, leaving the agent's durables and ACL row on the broker and replacing the refusal with the raw filesystem error. Each step now runs whatever an earlier one did, and the refusal keeps its `agent auth preflight failed` sentence and appends each failed step. Despawn teardown no longer stops at a file it cannot remove: it still revokes the grant and deletes the broker footprint, then reports the file and keeps the name held. A hosted spawn whose staged token cannot be deleted from the store after the host re-keys it is refused instead of reporting success.

## 0.67.0

### Minor Changes

- f389576: `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` carries a Claude session held on the operator's host to a manager on another host, as `docs/design/resume-transfer.md` lays out. The CLI finds the transcript with the connector's new `resumeTranscript` locator and writes it into a JetStream Object Store bucket owned by the target instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, as a chain that an interrupted carry continues. The manager's new operator-only `transcript-receive` command stages it, removes the broker object, and issues a one-time `resumeClaim` that `spawn` consumes; a re-run of the same bytes moves none. The seat forks the transcript in a seat-private Claude home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps --wide` names the source host, session, digest and carry time. The manager cluster document moves to revision 21. Two one-shot credentials carry it on an authenticated mesh: a `transfer-writer` the CLI mints from the space's signing seed for the one transcript it hashed, or on a user-auth mesh exchanges from the operator's login as the new `transfer-writer` view (scope `admin`), and a `transfer-reader` the target manager mints for its own bucket on each receive or sweep, or that the host issues a remote manager through the new manager-service `transferReader` operation. A carried seat records the digest of the transcript Claude forked, and the manager stops a seat whose record does not match the carried bytes, including one whose launch was uncertain and that joined later. Space deletion lists the transfer buckets and deletes them: `deleteSpace` given the space's trust material mints its own `teardown` naming them, and it now throws naming every stream it could not delete instead of reporting success. The console space picker deletes a space this host registered as a static-auth mesh that way. The `transfer-writer` view, and the broker connection minted from it, lives at most five minutes, the static credential's lifetime.

### Patch Changes

- 48f18d0: Remove sentences from shipped comments in core, lang, the CLI and the manager that described what earlier revisions of those comments claimed. The request-path validation note in `endpoint-envelope.ts` now states as current fact that registration-time profile bounds do not replace request-path enforcement, with the `uniqueItems` measurement under it. The barrier-window note in `endpoint-action.ts`, the lang worker header, the worker result backstop, the `--rotate-sys` broker check and the manager's goal-writer epoch belt keep their contract text and drop the history. No behavior changes.
- a0a5b75: A same-lifecycle restart or a resume now fails when the manager cannot record the new seat's custody reference on its static slot. It used to log the failure, or return silently when the slot was not this lifecycle's active row, and start or keep the seat anyway, so the slot still named the previous seat. A successor manager then reaped that seat, found it already gone, and retired the lifecycle and freed the name while the new seat kept running outside every manager. A restart that cannot record the reference now retires the seat, and a resume fails and stops any seat it started. A resumed seat whose stop cannot be proved stays managed and the resume's error names it, so it is never dropped while it still runs.
- 5b0da88: Breaking: the issuance-gate types now carry the op rule the gate parsers already enforce. `EpGateRow`, `EndpointGateRow` and `EpGateState` declared `op` optional in every state, so each reader re-derived it with placeholders, assertions and fallbacks for a case the parsers refuse. They are now a union on `state` over a shared `GateOp`: `open` carries no op, and `frozen` and `retired` always carry one. A reader that has checked the state reads `op` directly, and an in-memory gate or barrier that freezes or retires without recording its op no longer compiles. Because they are no longer interfaces, an `interface` that extends one fails with TS2312; declare it as an intersection such as `type CustomGateRow = EpGateRow & { custom: string }` instead. The endpoint gate's mint fence and registration barrier also read the `epgate` row through one shared reader and one mapping into `EpGateState`, so the two `observe` members can no longer refuse a DEL marker or carry the row's fields differently. Gates that parsed before parse the same way, and the refusals are unchanged.
- 79e5268: Every request that carries a manager's `identities` now goes through one parser, `parseRemoteManagerIdentities`, and one name list, `REMOTE_MANAGER_IDENTITY_NAMES`, both exported from core. The run admission and run attempt parsers had their own copy, which checked only that each id was a string. A non-nkey id got through to the proof check and was refused there as `permission-denied`, and a wrong key set got a message that did not name the expected keys. Both now refuse with the same `bad-request` messages as the other manager requests: "identities.<name>.id must be a user nkey" and "identities must contain exactly supervisor, executor, serve, goalWriter, sessionLedger". The auth parsers, the credential checks in authority issuance and the manager's standing renewal checks now use the shared list too, so a change to the identity set happens in one place.
- bb0b14e: A manager's per-root identity no longer travels with a mesh's trust folder. The instance identity and the goal-writer and session-ledger identities now live in the root's own space segment, `.cotal/space.<space-hex>/manager-instance.json` and `manager-siblings.json`, instead of `.cotal/auth`. Copying `.cotal/auth` to another root, as the docs describe for a mesh you did not start, used to copy them too, so `cotal supervise` there was refused as the original manager while it ran, and came up as that same instance once it stopped. A root that still holds the records in `.cotal/auth` has them moved on first use and keeps its instance across the upgrade; both locations holding a record is refused. When the manager lease refusal comes from a manager in a different root, it now says "another workspace root" instead of "this workspace root", and it reports the holder of the conflicting instance's own lease.
- 3069425: A manager on an authenticated mesh now keeps its goal-writer and session-ledger identities across restarts, as it already kept its serve identity. They were minted fresh on every start, so each restart added two holders to the manager's credential family, which never drops a row, and every later re-registration verify-evicted all of them again before the manager answered on its endpoint rails. The two identities are minted on the first start into a new secret file beside the instance identity (`.cotal/space.<space-hex>/manager-siblings.json`), published by exclusive create so concurrent first starts adopt one pair, and read back on every later start. A malformed file fails the start rather than being replaced. A family that already grew keeps its rows and is still swept on each restart, but restarts no longer add to it. `@cotal-ai/workspace` exports the `claimManagerSiblingIdentities` helper that does this.
- c3601f9: A logged-in user's workflow run on a `cotal supervise` participant manager can spawn, turn and despawn agents that user owns and receive their typed answers. The run's spawn takes the admin reach of the user who started the run, read from that user's actor-ledger row when the spawn runs, so a space that requires the event plane no longer refuses it and a revoked login demotes it. The host pins each run mediator it signs for a participant manager to a placement on that manager's own instance, so a program may place a spawn there; a placement on any other instance is refused at `run start`. A completed run now releases a seat by the identity its spawn terminal records, so a seat the host enrolled at its own lifecycle UID is despawned instead of left running.

## 0.66.0

### Minor Changes

- 658c1b8: Breaking: the `ai.cotal.ep.lifecycle-blocked` refusal detail now reports only the state the refusing site read. `headState` is optional and set only where the lifecycle head was read; a new `gateState` (`frozen` or `retired`) is set where the issuance gate was read. A gate frozen by a takeover, a registration or another retirement used to report `headState: "retiring"` over an active head or a service instance with no head, and a retired gate reported `headState: "retired"` with no head. `blockedOp` is the gate's own op kind instead of defaulting to `registration`, and `registerServiceInstance` refuses a frozen gate observed without a valid op (a string `opId` and one of the four op kinds) as `internal`. The manager's reserved-name refusal no longer claims a head state. A client that read `headState` from a gate refusal must read `gateState`.

### Patch Changes

- af779f9: Core exports `registerServingInstance`, which runs `registerServiceInstance` and then authorizes the instance's serve grant and writes its `ready` status at the `processEpoch` and `registrationRevision` that registration committed, both fenced on the registration barrier's read of the issuance gate. It returns `{ registrationRevision, processEpoch, grant }`, and an optional `status` adds fields to the ready status. The auth plane's own boot registration, the manager's boot registration and `registerRemoteManagerAuthority` now call it instead of assembling the grant and status by hand, so the epoch these steps run at comes from one place. Their behavior is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- f01aa7c: A manager start now serves at the process epoch its own registration committed. Both the boot registration and `registerRemoteManagerAuthority` read the issuance gate again after `registerServiceInstance` returned and took that read's epoch, so a start that a second start of the same instance superseded in between authorized its serve grant at the successor's epoch, and the remote path returned the successor's epoch and registration revision as its own. `registerServiceInstance` now returns the `processEpoch` its completing reopen committed, both registration paths use it, and the serve grant's epoch check refuses a superseded start with `expired`.

## 0.64.0

### Minor Changes

- d121d21: Design record for carrying a detached `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` session to a manager on another host (`docs/design/resume-transfer.md`). The transcript moves through a per-space JetStream Object Store bucket for the target manager instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, with a chunk chain that resumes an interrupted upload and a content-addressed staging copy that makes a repeat move no bytes. The manager gains the operator-only `transcript-receive` command and `spawn` gains a one-time `resumeClaim`. The carried transcript is placed in a seat-private Claude config home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps` and `cotal attach` show where a seat was resumed from. The implementation follows this record in the same change.

### Patch Changes

- 6c79419: A registration refused because another instance holds the endpoint governance slot now carries an `ai.cotal.ep.foreign-slot-held` detail with the holder's instance id and the condition that refused (`no-seam`, `unreadable`, `garbled`, `behind` or `in-flight`). A remote manager reads that detail instead of matching the refusal's message, and asks its host to reconcile the holder only when the holder's gate is still frozen at the slot's stamp. Before, it asked the host for every foreign-slot refusal, so a holder gate that was missing or read below the stamp surfaced the host's "no endpoint gate" or "not frozen" refusal in place of the registration's own, and rewording the core message would have turned the recovery off with no failing check.

## 0.63.0

### Minor Changes

- 22e210a: Start an already-enrolled managed agent in a child outside the manager's filesystem (SPEC §13.17). A runtime may offer `Runtime.spawnDelegated(launch, handoff)`. A manager whose runtime does enrolls through `enrollManagedAgent` once, refuses `--resume`, a manifest agent's `continuity: exact`, `--cwd`, shared MCP servers and non-string launch options before enrolling, never builds a local launch for the seat, and hands the lifecycle off at most once as one closed `cotal-managed-handoff/v1` value carrying the issued owner, actor, host-chosen lifecycle UID, sentinel, pinned exchange base and the raw actor token, which the host never receives. `delegatedSeatCommand` builds the child's `cotal spawn --expect-owner <owner> --expect-lifecycle-uid <uid>` command with `COTAL_MANAGED_HANDOFF_FILE` naming the handoff file. The `cotal` entry takes and deletes that file and drops the variable under any letter case before it parses flags, prints help or loads extensions, including when it refuses an older Node, and refuses spellings that name different files after deleting each of them. The spawn refuses a foreign space, owner, actor or lifecycle UID, an unknown field, a wrong kind and a file that is not a private regular file before any broker connection or exchange request, then runs the enrollment-redeem consumer without redeeming or minting, and exchanges through `agent-bearer --exchange-url` unchanged. No refusal on that path echoes a value from the handoff: the registration's server, exchange and enforcement checks, the local state this machine keeps for the space (its mesh record, user-auth state and agent secret files), target resolution, the policy refresh, the broker preflight, the agent auth preflight and the event-plane policy each refuse with a fixed sentence naming the field and the phase, whether a check fails or a filesystem, exchange or broker error is thrown under it, and an actor that is not a single token or a space that cannot name local state is refused as malformed before any plane. Readiness stays presence-observed, so a lost create acknowledgement settles uncertain and stays held. Every stop of a delegated seat, the reap of a child whose parent exited and a destructive manager shutdown included, runs prepare-retirement, then the handle's fenced close by `managedRuntimeKey`, then the terminal barrier. A preservation cut refuses a delegated seat at prepare time, and a manager stop after a refused cut retires it the same way. A provider resource is bound to that key only by the provider's authenticated answer to its create. The design record, the embedding guide, the CLI and configuration references and SPEC §13.17 describe the shipped shape.
- c975258: A logged-in user can now run hosted workflows on a user-auth space. The auth callout issues an interactive user's `manager-caller` view as an issuance (SPEC 13.15): it chooses the generation, records evidence whose one source is the user's actor-ledger row, and writes the accepted row under a token derived from the connection's inbox nonce, renewing that generation on a reconnect whose ceiling is unchanged. `cotal run` and the other manager calls read the generation back with the new `issuedUserCaller` and ride `ep.v1`, so `cotal run start` against a participant manager started with `cotal supervise` is admitted. The issuing host admits a run from a user caller only for the manager's registered owner, and a participant manager now forwards the served subject of every caller resume and answer, which the host checks against the run's owner and the caller's live issuance; a legacy-rail resume is refused. The issuing host subscribes to those resume and answer request subjects itself and issues for a forwarded one only when it observed that request, only once, and only for the run a resume's envelope names or the endpoint and amendment an answer's envelope names, and never for a request bound to another manager instance or epoch or declaring another class or pinning another contract than the manager registered for that command. Every answering operator issuance must carry that served subject, and an amendment's carries `answers.amend: true`, which the host accepts only for a pause settled with an accepted answer, so `cotal run amend` works on a participant manager. A user caller starts, resumes and answers runs only on the participant manager that user registered, and a static caller keeps its admission there. A managed seat's manager call keeps the legacy rail when the broker refuses its accepted-row read, which surfaces as a request error caused by the permission violation. Revoking or re-granting the actor makes its issuances dead at the next resolution. New exports: `connectionAcceptedToken`, `actorLedgerSource`, `actorLedgerSourceBucket`, `parseActorLedgerSource`, `issuedUserCaller` and `isDerivedOwner` in core, and `ledgerActorSourceIsLive` and `UserCallerIssuer` in auth. `manager-caller` joins the issuable profiles, and the `issuer` profile gains the per-key read of the accepted store. SPEC §13.15 gains a **User-auth issuance** paragraph and §14.8 a **User-auth runs** paragraph, both insertions; `docs/design/user-auth-run-start.md` records the path, and `docs/cli.md`, `docs/workflows.md` and `docs/run-a-mesh.md` describe it. `docs/run-a-mesh.md` also says the stock auth service refuses managed-agent enrollment and retirement preparation for a host platform to intercept.

### Patch Changes

- da45107: A manager whose SecretStore differs from the delivery daemon's no longer holds the space's daemon-credential renewal lease. Its renewal pass already released the lease, but the lease heartbeat took it back a few seconds later and kept it until the next pass, six hours on. On the split topology with `cotal up --no-manager` on the broker host and the only manager on another root, that manager never reminted and still blocked the renewal: a manager started on the daemon's own root lost the lease to it, and `cotal doctor auth --fix` on the broker host refused with `held by manager`, so `delivery.creds` and `membership-rw.creds` expired. The heartbeat now contends only while the manager's last store check found the daemon on its own store or found no daemon, so `doctor auth --fix` on the broker host renews the daemon credentials again.
- 5738154: A restarting manager on an authenticated mesh now verify-evicts its superseded credential family in one shared sweep per 256 holders instead of one holder at a time. The family keeps a ledger row for every credential an earlier incarnation was issued, and every boot adds fresh goal-writer and session-ledger holders, so the re-registration's eviction step grew with each restart: every holder cost a freshly minted credential, a new broker connection and its own delivery-admin request, and the progress cursor was rewritten after each one. After enough restarts the manager stayed off its endpoint rails for minutes while `cotal ps` got no answer from it, and a sweep that outlived the executor window looped on `manager registration executor expired`. Re-registration now sends the pending holders through the `evictPrincipals` verb that `cotal reconcile-gate` and the boot self-heal already use, records the verified ones after each request before it sends the next, and still leaves the gate frozen when any holder is not verified gone. `cotal reconcile-gate` and the boot self-heal now also record each request's verified holders before the next, so a family past 256 holders keeps the requests that already succeeded when a later one is refused or the executor window closes. The registration barrier's `evict` seam in `@cotal-ai/core` now takes the holder set and answers one verdict per holder, and the barrier's `evictMax` caps how many holders one call carries. A remote manager's host still evicts one principal per maintenance call, so its barrier sets `evictMax` to 1 and a refused host call keeps every holder the host verified before it. The 60-second wait for a delivery daemon that is still binding applies to each of those requests, and each request mints its own short-lived credential so the wait never outlives it.
- a2fe3a2: Stop a superseded manager from serving. If a manager stalled long enough for a second process of the same instance to take its liveness lease and register at a newer epoch, the first process logged that another pid held its key and kept serving. On an open mesh nothing evicted it, so both processes answered the instance's rail. A manager whose lease is held by another process now logs that the other process serves the instance, and exits. It does not deregister on the way out, because the registration is the successor's now. A lease that cannot be renewed or read, or that expired and can be put back, still never ends the process.

## 0.62.0

### Minor Changes

- bcf66d6: Add a delegated user intent: SPEC §13.16, a design record, and the host decisions it needs. A signed-in user admits one launch or one retirement on the host's authenticated route, and a platform control holder consumes that intent once from its current registration, epoch, assignment revision and lifecycle. `@cotal-ai/core` adds the closed request types and parsers for the user's intent and the holder's execution, `parseRemoteDelegatedUserIntentExecutionResult`, and `resolveReadAcl`, the read-list resolution `provisionAgentDurables` already used. `@cotal-ai/auth` adds `authorizeDelegatedUserIntentAdmission` and `authorizeDelegatedUserIntentExecution`, the record, pin and flight types, `delegatedUserIntentHoldsAlias` and `joinOrStartDelegatedUserIntent`, `AuthServiceHandle.observeManagerGate`, which a platform composition's handle carries so the host reads the holder's gate over the context's own connection, and `AuthServiceHandle.activateManagedLifecycle`, which activates a delegated launch's lifecycle at its pinned UID before any row or durable and mints nothing, so a launch the host compensates or the user retires reaches the terminal barrier even when its agent never exchanged. Admission derives nothing from the request: it takes the owner the host derived from the verified IdP subject, requires `spawn` on the user's own fresh ledger row, binds the account's current platform assignment and the holder's open gate, and dry-runs the envelope walk from the user's principal over the read list the writer will provision. Execution compares the request with the record and with the fresh assignment, gate epoch and registration proof, and returns the user's owner and parent for the host's writers. The holder gains no grant, no decision reads `supervise`, and the `platform-control` view's same-owner rule is unchanged. Stock dispatch refuses both kinds as `unimplemented`; a host that owns an intent store and the enrollment and retirement writers composes the decisions on its own routes. `@cotal-ai/manager` adds `remoteAuthority.executeDelegatedUserIntent`, `StartAgentOpts.delegatedIntent` and `Manager.retireDelegatedAgent`: a delegated launch takes the hosted enrollment arm with the intent's execution and refuses material under any owner but the intent's, and `retireDelegatedAgent` stops a delegated agent only after the host confirms `retired: true` for its exact target and operation id. A delegated agent's name, including one whose launch failed at any step after the host's enrollment answer, stays held until then.

### Patch Changes

- ad13f77: In a space with more than one static manager, `inspect` for a seat hosted by another manager instance now says so. The class queue hands the read to either instance, and the one that did not host the seat answered `not-found: no agent "<name>"`, the same reply as a name that exists nowhere. A named `cotal_despawn` resolves its target through this read, so it refused a live seat with an error that read as absence whenever the lookup reached the other manager. On a live-map miss the manager already reads the durable slot; when a nonretired slot names a sibling instance as its owner it now answers `failed-precondition` with the slot detail plus `ownerInstanceId`, and a message that names the owning instance. A name with no slot, or only a retired one, is still `not-found`.
- 5fff122: A manager that starts while the delivery daemon is still binding, or while the daemon has stepped back to re-check its lease, now waits up to 60 seconds for the `ctl.delivery-admin` rail to answer instead of exiting on the first unanswered request. The wait covers the three boot steps that need the daemon: the SecretStore challenge, the boot self-heal's freeze-holder liveness check, and the re-registration's verified eviction of the superseded serve family. Before, `cotal up` could start a manager inside that window, the manager exited with `could not challenge the delivery daemon's SecretStore` or with `re-registration could not revoke + verify-evict the superseded serve family; the gate is left frozen`, and nothing restarted it until an operator ran `cotal up` again. Only a request that times out or finds no responder is retried. Retries come closer together as the wait runs out, so a daemon that binds in its last seconds is still asked, and the wait ends on time even while a retry is still connecting, with nothing sent after it. A daemon that answers still fails the start at once when it refuses or sends a reply the manager cannot read, and a daemon that stays silent for the whole wait still fails it with the same message as before. Renewal passes and `cotal reconcile-gate` keep their single attempt.
- cc90060: The manager no longer reissues a numbered spawn name. Before, once `reviewer_2` despawned and its name was released, the next `reviewer` collision got `reviewer_2` again, so one name labeled two different agents in rosters and channel history. A numbered name is now issued once per manager process and a later collision takes the next number. Base persona names stay reusable, a hard-pinned `--name` is unaffected, and a restarted manager starts its record of issued numbers empty.
- fcbf8e4: A `cotal supervise --roster` entry now takes a `share-tools:` list that narrows the operator's declared MCP servers for that agent, the same selection `spawn --share-tools` makes: an absent key keeps every declared server, `[]` shares none, and an undeclared name fails that entry. Before this the roster loader dropped the key, so every rostered agent launched with the full pool. A value that is not a list, or a name the flag cannot carry unchanged such as `none` alone or one with a comma or surrounding spaces, fails the roster load.
- 97a2382: The cotal config accepts a `modelPolicy` that names, per role, the models (and optionally the variants) a seat in that role may launch on. The manager refuses a detached spawn, and `cotal spawn` refuses a foreground one, before anything is minted when the effective role has an entry and the effective model is missing or not on its list, or its variant is missing or off a declared variants list, or the launch carries launch options (from `launchOptions:` or `--opt`), which the connector applies unread after the model and which can select another model. Ids compare whole, so `vendor/model-B-fast` does not satisfy `vendor/model-B`. The refusal names the persona, whether the value came from its own `model:` or `variant:` field or from `--model` or `--variant`, the value found, and the values allowed. Roles without an entry are unconstrained, a space-local entry replaces the operator-level entry for the same role, and a malformed policy (including an unsupported field of any name) fails the spawn loudly. Before this, a persona pinned to a superseded model, or to none, launched on it with no report.
- 5ef9a67: Bare `cotal down` stops a stack whose manager runs the built-in `pty` runtime and has never started an agent. Since the `pty` runtime stopped using a seat custodian, its manager published no spare capability at all, so bare `cotal down` refused every default stack, left the broker running and kept the space registered, and the next `cotal up` of that space was refused as already in use. Ctrl-C on a foreground `cotal up` now holds the manager's stop reservation from its capability check until the manager exits, as `cotal down` does, so a concurrent `cotal down` cannot stop that manager or arm a reap while the Ctrl-C stop is in flight.
- 565036c: Let bare `cotal down` and Ctrl-C on a foreground `cotal up` stop a stack whose manager runs the built-in in-process `pty` runtime. That manager published no spare capability, so bare `cotal down` refused to signal it even with no agents running, left the broker up, and kept the registry entry; a default `Manager.stop()` threw on any pty seat. A default stop now stops and deprovisions the pty seats that live inside the manager process, since they cannot outlive it, and still releases every seat that can. The manager always publishes its spare capability, which now records whether its stop also stops in-process seats, and `down` reports those seats as stopped instead of left running. An older CLI refuses the new record rather than misreport those seats. A stopping manager refuses new spawns and waits for the ones it already accepted, so no seat launches after a stop that reported success, and `down` no longer promises that agents will be spared when it cannot list them. Repeated `Manager.stop()` calls share one stop, so a second call no longer reports success while the first still waits for a seat to exit.
- 9236a12: Recover an ordinary resume whose coordinator and manager were both lost after the retained agents launched. The coordinator journals `resume-active` only after the manager's launch returns, so a crash in between left `resume-intent` behind a live agent, and the replacement manager refused it as `already live and this runtime cannot authoritatively adopt it`, leaving the journal degraded and the agent owned by nobody. On a static mesh the replacement manager now reads the seat reference the lost manager recorded on that agent's slot, reaps the seat through its runtime, waits for the principal to leave presence, and launches it again. A live principal with no such record, or one that stays live after the reap, is still refused. Tmux handles now carry a reference bound to the tmux server, window and pane, and the tmux runtime can reap by it, so a successor manager also closes the window of a tmux seat it retires instead of leaving it running. The reap closes that window even when the agent's pane already exited, since `remain-on-exit` or a second pane keeps the window open. It refuses a pane that has moved out of that window, whether it still runs or has exited, and a window that has moved out of the session, including one that moves while the reap runs.

### Patch Changes

- 3b616a2: A manifest agent can declare `continuity: exact` to come back in its previous harness session. The manager records the session the connector proves over its authenticated control endpoint on the first launch, keeps that record current through crash recovery, preserved resume and stop, reopens it on every later launch and preserved resume under the same proof, and refuses one recorded for another space, connector or directory. A reopen fails when the harness no longer has the session rather than starting an empty one under the same id: connectors declare the new `supportsSessionReopen` capability and honor `LaunchOpts.reopenSession`, and Pi reopens with `--session`. Preflight refuses `exact` on a connector that cannot reopen an existing session.

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- 70bcfe3: Breaking: `cotal actor grant` no longer turns an omitted ACL flag into the wide default, so a bare grant that used to succeed now needs `--full`. A grant must name `--scope`, `--allow-subscribe` and `--allow-publish`, or pass `--full` to take `spawn,role:default`, `>` and `>` for the ones left off. Otherwise it refuses, writes nothing, and prints both forms. Dropping one flag from a narrow event-plane reader grant used to mint a row that read or posted to every channel, or could spawn, with a success line as the only sign. The hints printed by `cotal login`, `cotal status`, `actor list` and the not-granted refusal now include `--full`.
- c389563: Hosted runtime create and status for managed agents. Core adds the closed `manager-managed-agent-runtime-create` and `manager-managed-agent-runtime-status` kinds on the manager-service-authority transport, with parsers that refuse any unknown top-level or target field, including `providerRef`, `handle`, and `name`. Core also adds a result builder and binder whose `state`, `readiness`, and optional `retirementPhase` come from closed sets. The auth service adds `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentRuntimeCreate` and `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentRuntimeStatus`. Each applies the enrollment door's gate, epoch, and proof checks, reads `supervise` from the manager actor's own ledger row, and returns only `{ owner, instanceId, actor, target }`. The loopback verify-enrollment door serves both kinds, and stock dispatch refuses them with `unimplemented`. The manager client adds `remoteManagedAgentRuntimeRequest` and `remoteManagedAgentRuntimeState`. The enrollment result gains an optional, display-only `runtimeIntent: { state: "reserved" }`, which older hosts omit and the manager never treats as authority.

### Patch Changes

- 608f5f4: Re-attach doc comments that had drifted away from the declarations they document. A `/** */` block followed directly by another one documented nothing, so editor hovers and the published type declarations showed no doc for the intended declaration (for example `Manager`, the `plane3` field and `AclResolver`). Each such block now sits above its declaration, is merged into the block it duplicated, or is removed when its declaration no longer exists. A new `pnpm check:doc-comments` check, run as part of `check:docsbundle`, refuses a doc block followed directly by another in shipped source.
- 4a12111: The hosted `cotal run ps` now reads each run's revocation marker, as `run ps --local` already did. A revoked run whose driver died is listed as `revoked` with the revoker and reason instead of `running`, and a marker the manager cannot read prints `unchecked` and exits 1. The `run-ps` rows gain optional `revoked` and `revocationUnreadable` fields; the record's own `state` is unchanged.
- b4c69bf: A seat whose turn died on a harness-reported error now shows it on every operator surface. A Jcode seat relays the Harness error code, such as a provider `rate_limit`, as its presence `condition`, both for a turn the host drives and for one the TUI owns. `cotal ps` now carries that condition: the human row reads `waiting (rate_limit)` and `--json` rows include the `condition` object, alongside the roster, `cotal status` and `cotal endpoints`. The next turn clears the condition when it starts. Before, the seat read a bare `waiting` and the error was recorded only in its private connector log.

  Presence gains an optional `activeAt`: the epoch ms of the last work event the harness reported, carried on the next heartbeat. A Jcode seat records every token and tool event of its session there. `cotal ps`, `cotal status`, `cotal endpoints` and `cotal_roster` now print a condition with its age and the age of the last work event, such as `waiting (rate_limit for 40m) · active 40m ago`, and `cotal ps --json` rows carry `activeAt`. A turn that stopped advancing while its process keeps heartbeating no longer reads like one that is still working.

- 5f13124: Private launch files now have an owner. The Claude persona file, the Claude shared-server MCP config file and the pi persona file are listed on the new `LaunchSpec.artifacts`, and the launcher removes them once it has proved the agent process gone. On the default pty runtime the manager removes them when it sees the agent exit; on tmux, cmux, orca and herdr the manager removes them by polling the seat's status and waiting for the runtime's exit proof; the foreground `cotal spawn` removes them when its child exits. Every one of those launches also starts its child through the new core `reclaimWithChild`: a watcher started beside the child removes the files once the child's process is gone, and tries a failed removal again every five seconds until it succeeds, so a killed manager or foreground `cotal spawn` no longer strands them (POSIX; Windows has no shell for the watcher). Each directory name carries a random per-launch identity, so a stale path can never name a later launch's directory. The tmux, cmux, orca and herdr runtimes now throw the new core `SpawnRefused` for an unsafe name, an unreachable backend, (herdr) a missing working directory or an unknown layout, (orca) a working directory that is missing or outside any Orca worktree, and a launcher script they cannot write or (tmux, herdr) a session or server that will not start, all before the agent's command is handed to the backend, and the manager removes the files at once. A removal that fails, after an exit or after a refusal, is tried again until it succeeds. A batch resume removes the files of specs it built and never launched. Both connectors now refuse a bad model, prompt or launch option before writing anything. Any other spawn that throws is not proof that nothing started, so its files stay for the child's watcher, or for the OS temp reaper when no child started, as do a killed launcher's on Windows. A seat started under a custodian with `launchSeat` from `@cotal-ai/seat`, which the manager no longer does for a new launch, hands them to that custodian: a launch it refuses before any process started removes them at once, the custodian removes them when it sees the agent exit, a removal that fails stays on the custody record, and a reap that proves the seat gone removes what the record still lists from the temp dir the launch wrote to, so a successor with a different `TMPDIR` still removes them. Losing a custodian's connection no longer counts as the agent's exit. The docs now say that owner-private means any process running as the same user can read the file while it exists.
- fb1bc26: Keep the liveness responders bound across reconnects

  A liveness responder was bound once, on the connection that was current when it started. A full
  endpoint reconnect closed that connection and the responder with it. The remote manager runs one
  after every credential renewal. A peer probing the plane then got the broker's no-responders answer
  and was told `unbound` while the manager or the delivery daemon was connected and serving. The
  endpoint now keeps each responder as intent and binds it again on every connection it opens, under
  a new responder token.

  The manager's responder also answered `bound` after its service connection closed, for as long as
  it waited to re-dial, because it only checked that it still held a serve handle. It now answers
  `unbound` until the re-dial has bound the service again.

- fb1bc26: Report the manager plane unbound while its service connection reconnects

  The manager's liveness responder answered `bound` whenever its service connection was not closed.
  That connection reconnects without limit, so after a drop it stays open while the broker holds none
  of its service subscriptions, and a probe answered on the separate supervisor connection said
  `bound` for a manager that could not be reached. The responder now also requires the service
  connection to be connected, so a peer is told `unbound` until the client has reconnected and
  subscribed again.

- 4d2dcae: The systemd user unit that `cotal service install` writes now sets a start limit (`StartLimitIntervalSec=30min`, `StartLimitBurst=20`), so a manager that cannot start stops after 20 attempts instead of restarting every 20 seconds forever. The manager's restart eviction also stops reporting a delivery daemon that answered and refused as "not reachable on the ctl.delivery-admin rail" with advice to start the daemon. A refusal now carries the daemon's own reason, such as a missing `$SYS` cred and how to re-mint it, and only a rail that cannot be reached is reported as unreachable. A manager that cannot verify eviction of its predecessor still exits 1 with the gate frozen (SPEC 13.1).
- 57d77ab: Finish manager shutdown when a managed agent cannot be proven stopped. The manager still closes its broker connections and console listener and exits with code 1, where it used to stay running with its connections open and ignore every later SIGINT or SIGTERM.
- 06f48f4: CLI output is plain text when stdout is not a terminal or `NO_COLOR` is set to a non-empty value. The shared color helpers used to wrap every string in ANSI escapes, so `cotal --help`, `cotal status`, `cotal meshes` and the red error lines on stderr carried escapes into pipes and log files. The manager's and the delivery daemon's own always-on copies are gone; `cotal supervise` and `cotal feedback-intake` now print through the same helpers. The guided `cotal setup` and `cotal meshes add` prompts follow the same rule, so `FORCE_COLOR` now reaches them too. `FORCE_COLOR` turns color back on even when output is piped, unless it is `0` or `false`, and it takes precedence over `NO_COLOR`, the order Node uses.
- fb1bc26: Let a credentialed peer ask which plane is broken, instead of guessing at its own credentials

  The subjects that answer "is the manager alive" are owner-only, so a peer holding perfectly valid
  credentials could not ask. When its join or its send failed, that peer could not tell a credential
  problem from a dead manager, an unbound delivery daemon, or a broker that was entirely healthy, so
  every failure presented as a credential failure, because that was the only hypothesis it was able to
  form. A reporter running a 30-agent deployment for a week recorded six independent surfaces that each
  reported success over a failure, including a `pgrep` that matched its own command line and therefore
  failed in both directions. In every case diagnosis cost hours rather than minutes, and in every case
  the missing piece was the same: nothing could be asked whether it was alive by anyone who did not own
  it.

  A read-only liveness surface now answers that question. A peer sends a presence probe on
  `live.<plane>.<owner>.<actor>` and learns whether the manager and the delivery daemon have bound
  responders for the space. It is shaped like the Synadia micro protocol's `$SRV.INFO`, a well-known,
  read-only, presence-only request/reply probe, but it rides a Cotal subject inside the space rather
  than the literal `$SRV` tree, which sits outside per-space account isolation and outside every grant
  builder and subject audit the system already enforces.

  Presence is the whole answer. The reply carries the plane, one responder verdict and an opaque
  per-bind responder token (below), and nothing else: no holder, no pid, no workspace root, no
  runtime, no roster, and no instance id, since the token is minted from nothing and names no
  instance. That is why the probe is a
  request rather than a lease read: the manager's lease row carries the operator's filesystem path and
  a process id, so the responder reduces it to a single enum and the row never crosses the wire. A peer
  gains no read of either lease bucket, cannot probe under another principal's identity, and cannot
  subscribe the responder's serve filter to answer for a plane it does not own.

  Unknown stays first class, reusing the classifier `cotal status` already grades by. Only the broker's
  own no-responders answer becomes "unbound"; a timeout, a permission refusal or an unreadable reply
  all become "unknown", because each is a failure to find out, and reporting a failure to find out as
  health is the defect this surface exists to remove. A responder that cannot determine its own state
  says so rather than guessing, and a reply is never counted as health merely for having arrived.

  The reply also names which responder answered it, as an opaque per-bind token and not an identity.
  Manager instances coexist per instance id, each responder answers only about itself, and the queue
  group hands one probe to one arbitrary member, so two instances holding opposite verdicts made
  identical probes alternate with nothing in the answer to say a second instance existed. With the
  token a caller that probes more than once can tell two responders apart from one responder that
  changed state. One probe still samples one responder and cannot report a split by itself.

  SPEC §6.1 defines the `live` subjects, the `LivenessAnswer` reply and its grading, and the
  message-flow docs page describes them.

  A remote manager can now answer the probe it already binds. It runs the same start path as a local
  supervisor, so it binds the manager plane's responder, and its credential carried neither the serve
  subscription nor the bounded reply row. The subscription was denied and a peer asking about the
  manager plane received the broker's own no-responders answer, which grades "unbound": a definite
  verdict about a plane that was in fact bound, produced by a gap in a credential. Both rows are now
  on that profile, pinned to the supervisor actor that does the serving.

  The responder's rejection notice for a reply target outside the sender's own subtree now travels on
  the endpoint's non-fatal warning channel. It was emitted on the `error` channel, and Node's
  `EventEmitter` rethrows an `error` emitted with no listener attached, so an embedder that had not
  attached one ended its process when a peer sent a probe naming such a target. The plane was then
  genuinely unbound and the next probe reported it as such, so the notice manufactured the state it
  described. The guard's behaviour is unchanged: the frame is dropped and the responder keeps serving.

- 438e9ed: Close the pid record publish window. A launcher that died between removing the old identity pin and publishing the new pidfile left the old pid with no pin, which teardown signalled with only a legacy warning, even when the removed pin had been refusing a reused pid. The publish now renames a bridge pin holding the old and the new record's lines before the pidfile commit, and teardown checks the pidfile's pid against its own line, so every crash point leaves the old or the new complete record. Publishes of one pidfile are serialized by a lock, so a launcher and the daemon it starts can no longer overwrite each other's bridge or settled pin. A publish that cannot read a start token for the new process gives it a `-` pin line, so a crash after the commit reads the legacy record it was publishing, never the new pid beside the old pin. Replacing a legacy record carries its line as `-`, so an interrupted replace leaves it legacy, never torn. Teardown and a daemon's exit cleanup remove a record under the same lock, and only while the pidfile still names the pid they stopped, so a stop that races a publish can no longer leave the new pidfile with no pin. `removeIdentityPin` is deprecated in favor of `removePidPair` and stays exported unchanged for one minor line.
- 61d6365: Stop starting a detached seat custodian for every default `pty` spawn on Linux. The built-in `pty` runtime now spawns in-process on every platform, the same as macOS and Windows, and reports `legacy` custody. On Linux it still adopts and reaps seats that an earlier manager left under a custodian, so existing seats drain under the new manager. Because the pty runtime can no longer spare its seats, a bare `cotal down` on Linux now asks for `cotal down --with-agents` while pty agents are running, as it already did on other platforms. The in-process pty runtime gives no hot-update guarantee. `cotal seats` lists the custody records an earlier Linux manager left, and `cotal seats --drain` retires each seat whose agent has exited. A seat whose agent still runs is never signalled, and a record that cannot be proved safe is refused and kept. A record with no start or boot identity, or one from an earlier boot, is refused by the read-only listing too, rather than reported as running or exited. The seat package exports the same inventory as `drainSeats`.
- 8ce6be3: The 0.33.0 changelog entry "An agent now reads only the channels it lists" now carries a correction. It presented the read-set default-deny as new in 0.33.0, but that shipped in 0.28.0 with #821, so upgrading from 0.28.0 or later needs no migration for it. The correction names what 0.33.0 did change: the no-default-channel check in `multicast` now refuses only an omitted channel, so an explicit empty-string `channel` is no longer refused as if it were omitted, and its refusal is reworded; the `cotal_send`, `cotal_leave` and pi tool text; doc comments; and two regression suites. `docs/release.md` now describes how to correct a released entry.
- 08194ec: `cotal reconcile-gate` now names the delivery lease blocker when the delivery daemon gives no liveness verdict. A `liveness-unestablishable` refusal used to advise starting the daemon with `cotal up` whatever the cause. It now reads `lease.0` and reports whether the lease is absent, unreadable, held by a daemon that is not ready, held by a ready daemon while the query went unanswered, or taken by another daemon while the query was outstanding, with the holder, the account, when the holder acquired the shard and when the row was last written. It reads the lease before the query and again after it fails, and names a holder as the blocker only when the same daemon run held the lease both times. For a ready holder it advises re-running before stopping anything, since the rail is queue-grouped and a stopped daemon still subscribed to it can take the query. It advises starting a daemon only when no lease exists. A row whose times are not valid dates reads as unreadable instead of failing the command. An explicit daemon refusal keeps its own reason and adds the same lease line. The manager's boot self-heal uses the same probe and reports the same line. The refusal, exit code 2 and the frozen gate are unchanged.

  The delivery lease row now carries `acquiredAt`, set when a daemon's acquisition of the shard succeeds and kept on every ready flip and renewal, while `since` still records the latest write. Rows from older daemons have no `acquiredAt`. `docs/cli.md` lists the lease readings.

- aa12a1a: Gate reconciliation no longer scales with credential family size. `cotal reconcile-gate`, manager boot self-heal and remote manager maintenance revoke the family's ledger rows 16 at a time, then verify-evict every distinct holder in one shared scan, KICK and verify sweep through the new `evictPrincipals` delivery-admin verb instead of one connection and one sweep per holder. The sweep keeps up to 16 KICK requests in flight, so a family whose holders are still connected no longer pays one broker round trip per connection. Holders a sweep verifies are still recorded durably when another holder is not verified, and an interrupted sweep records none.
- 569cb6f: A `--resume` seat's fork provenance is recorded on the manager. `LaunchSpec` gains `resumeRecordPath`, where a connector whose seat forks after launch has it record the source session id, the source title and a SHA-256 of the transcript it read; the Hermes and Jcode connectors declare it. The manager reads that record once the seat has written it, keeps it on the seat's resume document (an optional `resumed` field, so earlier documents still resume), and adds a `resume` object to the `ps`/`inspect` row (manager cluster revision 20). `cotal ps --wide` prints `forked from <id>` with the title and hash, and the Hermes and Jcode seats print the same facts when they fork. The Jcode fork now carries a count above 2^53 byte for byte instead of rounding it, refuses a count outside the u64 range by name, and refuses a fork record that is not an object by name.
- d0b1da3: Record a changed answer on a settled run step. `cotal run amend <runId> <stepKey>` files a new answer beside a settled checkpoint's or ask's accepted one, naming the answer it supersedes, and `cotal run journal` lists each amendment under the step in the order the store committed them, so the last one is the current position. Each filing is its own record, so returning to an earlier position is listed too. A settled `ask` now prints the answer it accepted, as a checkpoint does, read from its answer record even when the value is a record with fields named like a checkpoint's result. The pause stays settled and the run keeps the answer it acted on; a second `answer` is still refused. The hosted path is the `amend` form of the manager's `run-answer` command (cluster revision 19), and a spawned seat may amend only an answer recorded under its own name.
- 37075a2: `cotal run ps` and `cotal run journal` take `--json`, hosted or `--local`: one JSON object per row per line on stdout, with the run header and errors on stderr, as `cotal ps --json` does for seats. A run row adds its pinned `startedAt` and the `programHash` of its recorded program. A step row adds its effect kind and name, the recorded status and error code, its start and end times, and for an open pause its deadline and the `onExpiry` a checkpoint was armed with, which a checkpoint now records on its pending entry. An unreadable revocation marker under `--json` prints its reason to stderr and exits 1. `run ps --local` now reads its rows through the same listing the manager answers `run-ps` with, so both paths print the same rows.
- 8d8d69a: A pty seat whose process exits on its own is logged as `seat reaped: ... exit code <n>[, signal <s>]` followed by the last line the child printed that starts with a connector's `[cotal-<name>]` or `[cotal-<name>/<part>]` prefix, cut to 240 characters, such as `[cotal-jcode] AG-UI emitter stopped: ...` or `[cotal-hermes/bridge] ...`. This holds for a seat the manager spawned in-process and for one a seat custodian holds. The custodian now sends the child's exit code, signal and that diagnostic with its exit event, and the seat handle reports them through `exitInfo()`, so a custodial seat no longer reads `exit detail unavailable from runtime "pty"`. `@cotal-ai/seat` exports the shared `ConnectorDiagnosticReader`. The custodian writes the same record beside the custody record, so a reap of the seat by reference reports how the child ended. When that record cannot be written, the custodian logs why, and the reap of a child that ended on its own says the record is missing or unreadable.
- add9984: A managed seat that leaves the mesh while its process keeps running now says so. `cotal ps` prints how long the seat has been offline (`mesh offline for 3.5h`), and `--json` carries the seat's last presence heartbeat as `offlineSince`. The manager log gets a `seat offline on the mesh` line for each such seat, including one its watch first sees offline after a reconnect, and a `seat back on the mesh` line when it returns. Both read only the seat's own presence record, so a same-named peer never dates or logs for it. Before this, a seat could read `running · mesh offline` for days with nothing saying when it dropped, so a watchdog that checked process liveness saw nothing wrong.
- 88f5128: A spawn or resume refused at the manager's seat limit now states what holds the slots and whether waiting can free one, for example `at capacity (50 of 50 slots: 49 managed, 0 reserved, 1 cooling); waiting frees a cooling slot in 7s, or despawn one`. It quoted only the fixed limit, so an operator could not tell a cooling slot that frees in seconds from seats that never free on their own. The gate also counted a launching seat twice, once as a reservation and once as a managed seat, so it refused below the limit: with 49 seats in `cotal ps`, one of them still joining, a spawn was refused at 50. Each seat now counts once, including a seat that exits young while its launch is still reporting the failure, and the managed count is the number `cotal ps` lists for that manager. The refusal counts a launch as pending only while it holds a slot, so a launch whose seat already ended no longer tells the operator that waiting may help.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- 95ae645: The auth retirement rail is a conforming registered endpoint with a describable contract. The requester calls it through the generic client in the exact target mode. A legacy body is refused as unsupported-version.

### Patch Changes

- f5b723f: Allocate accepted-goal test homes as unique children of the selected temporary root. The prior concatenation attempted sibling paths such as `/tmpa` and hid permission failures as exhausted names on CI. Cover ordinary and pooled native paths with a root-containment assertion and mutation proof. Product runtime behavior is unchanged.
- 5831ef8: Pty seats are marked more killable than the broker (`oom_score_adj` 500 on the seat's PTY child), with a logged reason when the kernel refuses and an explicit unavailable line off Linux.
- 576f622: A process's pidfile and its identity pin now publish as one rename-based transition, so a crash between the two writes never leaves a torn pair (old pid beside a new pin, or a new pid beside an old one). A crash still leaves one of the legacy shapes teardown already handles.
- 7c54825: Distinguish native consumer deletion acknowledgments and observed disappearance from uniquely attributable removals. Refuse live KV CAS successors, preserve exact-target INFO grants, and propagate unknown uniqueness through Manager reconciliation. Count ACL and membership rows removed by a competing purge as observed disappearances, not prior absence or this caller's deletion.
- f758cd5: Expose the canonical manager activation document and closure manifest through `managerClusterArtifacts`. Public-only embeddings can complete prepare, registration and activation without importing private contract modules. Exercise the public Manager constructor and activation artifacts in the native continuity fixture; host validation, issuance policy and wire grants are unchanged.
- 5758877: Expose the stock remote manager request builders and response validators through the public `remoteManagerClient` namespace, along with native registration and its identity-state type. Embeddings can compose closed remote-authority callbacks without private imports or copied CLI policy. Add a package-root export gate and exercise the real native continuity path with public registration and client helpers; issuance policy and wire grants are unchanged.
- d4bb1f3: Renew an expired remote maintenance executor during clean shutdown without attempting to restart an already-drained standing credential family. Preserve all-duty renewal and its adoption fences while the manager is active.
- 397bc60: Deprovisioning returns truthful bounded resource accounting distinguishing deleted resources from absent no-ops across repeated teardown attempts. Key existence and tombstone state are verified through exact Direct Get checks before purging KV keys, ensuring repeated deprovisioning reports zero deleted entries. Partial broker failures record refused resources and raise DeprovisionError with partial accounting rather than discarding earlier progress.
- 7b3924c: Retire a lifecycle's durable membership rows through target-pinned exact-key grants. Complete inventory derives channels from validated native keys, including wildcard-covered and unnamed channels, so unreadable values cannot hide rows from cleanup. An unavailable inventory retains undiscovered rows and holds retirement pending retry. Other principals and successor lifecycles remain untouched. Retirement fixtures now use complete zero-row responses only for empty synthetic inventories, and the user-mode test verifies held retirement until genuine delivery returns.
- a726a3d: Register the hosted service and renewal checks with stable CI suite fragments, mark the restart fixture's broker for owned teardown, and verify unsupported seat reaping on other platforms without claiming Linux process-group coverage. Let the continuity fixture observe an already-started transport reconnect before preparing its recovery command.
- 59672dd: Register the remaining hosted-runtime smoke entrypoints in stable CI fragments and report native assertion counts through canonical completion markers. Refresh the explicit-TLS call-site census. Make the resume fixture retain its first successful held-slot observation or require durable completion with a new epoch, and exercise completion before the probe as a separate regression gate.
- fd0cf70: Retain custody records on disk across seat exit until verified reaping confirms kernel process identities and purges the directory, enabling manager process restart reconciliation. Refuse reaping when a dead leader leaves a nonempty group whose generation cannot be proved, retaining the custody record without signalling that group.
- 1721738: Support signerless manager run hosting through typed host admission, initial-attempt and renewal operations. Renew the complete standing credential family while preserving held identities, serve epochs and last-good credentials on refusal. Keep pooled managers off local PTY launch paths and enforce the execution host boundary. Update the native lifecycle and mutation checks for these paths.

### Patch Changes

- e7c702a: The jcode connector now reports the provider route serving a seat's model to presence, and `cotal ps --wide`/`--json` surface it as `provider`.
- 6f64bcc: The manager's `slots` command and `cotal ps --slots` list a static manager's durable static slot rows, projected the same way `inspect` reports a stranded name.

### Patch Changes

- 6b76946: A seat resumed from a preservation cut backfills its channels from the chat stream sequence its prior incarnation had reached instead of replaying the whole retained window.
- a4c5ffa: A `--config` spawn now records the persona's identity name as its preservation ref instead of the config path, and a preservation prepare that later refuses aborts the manager's attempt and clears the prepare intent so the mesh stays usable for the next `down --preserve-state`.

## 0.56.0

### Patch Changes

- 0d7649d: A same-name spawn after a completed retirement takes the exact alias instead of a numbered suffix while the retired seat's presence record ages out.
- 101f4ce: Every line the supervisor writes to `.cotal/manager.<key>.log` starts with the UTC time it was written, so a reaped seat can be placed in time from the log alone (#1423, ask 3).
- 3c40736: The own-channel refusal's remedy is chosen off the three-valued mesh mode, so an open mesh is told there is nothing to grant and to read the channel bare instead of being handed a `mint --provision` command the CLI refuses there (#567).
- 00257cf: The manager schedules its `endpoint-serve` credential renewal from the credential's own window instead of a quarter-TTL tick whose phase is set at boot, pushes the renewed credential to the live serve, goal-writer and session-ledger connections with a reconnect, and treats a closed serve connection as a fault: it re-dials with the current credential, re-mints an expired one, and after a bounded retry releases its lease and exits loud instead of holding the lease deaf (#2073).
- 5cf0861: `spawn` refuses at admission a `cwd` the serving manager's host cannot resolve, naming the path, the reason and the host, so a misplaced spawn in a multi-manager space fails before anything is minted instead of at launch (#385 item 2). `cotal_spawn` documents that an unresolvable `cwd` is refused before launch.

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e13607: Let a remote participant supervisor spawn and terminally release a HOST-OWNED managed agent (#1972). A registered participant holds no ledger writer, no JetStream provisioner, and no signing seed, so `cotal spawn <actor> -d --on <instanceId>` previously failed in auth preflight and a despawn refused outright.

  `@cotal-ai/core` adds the two closed wire operations and their parsers: `manager-managed-agent-enrollment` and `manager-managed-agent-prepare-retirement`. An enrollment carries the SHA-256 digest of the agent's standing actor token and never the token, and carries no lifecycle UID at all; a prepare-retirement's `opId` must be `managedRetirementOpId(target.lifecycleUid)`.

  `@cotal-ai/auth` adds `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentEnrollment` and `authorizeRemoteManagedAgentPrepareRetirement`, which require `supervise` at the caller instance's current open manager gate with the host-issued registration proof, plus the loopback door `POST /manager-service-authority/verify-enrollment` (`VERIFY_ENROLLMENT_PATH`) that a host platform calls for the decision while it owns every write. The door derives the caller's scope from the local ledger rather than the request body. `dispatchManagerAuthorityRequest` refuses both kinds with `unimplemented`, since stock owns no such storage, and the provider gains the `enrollRemoteManagedAgent` and `prepareRemoteManagedAgentRetirement` clients.

  `@cotal-ai/manager` adds the `remoteAuthority.enrollManagedAgent` hook and takes it in `provisionUserAgent`: the participant generates the actor token, writes it at 0600 before the request, sends only the digest, adopts the HOST's chosen lifecycle UID, and launches `agent-bearer --exchange-url`. `prepareAgentRetirement` now performs the host release instead of throwing.

### Patch Changes

- 427a848: Gate the event plane on the typed spawn contract behind the caller's admin tier on a user mesh (#373): a non-admin caller asking for `events: true` is refused before anything is provisioned, an omitted bit is served unarmed with a notice in the reply, and a space whose policy requires events refuses non-admin spawns outright. The CLI's detached spawn now sends the events bit only when the operator chose it and prints the reply's notice.
- 8120e34: The manager package now exports `SPAWN_INPUT_KEYS`, the `start` op's argument vocabulary as the served contract declares it, and the launch-parity smoke reads it from there instead of carrying a hardcoded copy.
- 64ec80e: The journal-model-b gate suite pins the spawn wiring at its current shape.
- 4918b65: A clean `Manager.stop()` now waits for a renew already in flight and releases the liveness lease key at the broker's own revision instead of a cached one, so a same-root restart no longer waits out the bucket TTL when a renew was racing the stop.
- d284ee6: A manifest or spawn prompt on a connector that cannot deliver one is refused at preflight (including `up -f --dry-run`), at spawn and in the manager, the way an unsupported model variant is: connectors now declare `supportsPrompt`, and claude, opencode, codex, jcode and pi declare it; hermes keeps its launch-time throw as the second line of defence.

## 0.54.0

### Minor Changes

- 34beea1: Route user-auth manager calls through a short-lived, instance-bound control credential. Discovery and invocation address the same authorized manager while the agent's standing connection, credentials and conversation remain unchanged. Managed launches retain their manager selection across launch and resume. Static and open mesh routing is unchanged. Confirm the standing goal-progress subscription at the broker before submitting on the separate control connection, so fast terminal events cannot outrun the subscription. Recover accepted goal results through the manager's caller-scoped `goal-result` command after connection replacement, without repeating the mutation or granting clients raw JetStream reads. Followed calls now require a compatible manager before submission; update the issuer, participant manager and client together. Stopping a caller cancels its observation without cancelling the accepted goal. Retain Linux custody records across clean child exit so retirement can prove process identity and finish cleanup even after the custodian removes its file; socket loss alone never frees the alias.

### Patch Changes

- e6badb8: Bind the delivery daemon's store-identity answer to the process that reloads

  The delivery-admin rail is queue-grouped, so the `reloadStoreIdentity` challenge is served by
  whichever bound responder the broker picks, while only the holder of the space's delivery lease
  actually reloads the standing credentials. The reply was a bare store identity and named no
  process, so a non-holder answering with a matching store let a manager conclude the stores were
  shared and remint into a store the reloading daemon never reads.

  The reply now carries the answering endpoint's identity and its own lease claim. The manager reads
  the delivery lease row itself, under its own credential, and requires the answerer to be the
  recorded holder. The answerer's claim is kept as a cross-check that must agree, so an honest
  non-holder is refused by its own admission and the operator-facing reason says which responder
  answered and who holds the lease. An unreadable lease row is undetermined and refuses, consistent
  with the existing convention that a hung rail fails closed.

  The supervisor credential gains a read-only point read of the delivery lease bucket, which is what
  lets the manager establish the holder itself rather than take a responder's word for it. It gains
  no write, delete or purge on that bucket: a credential able to write the row could manufacture the
  fact the challenge reads.

  A manager newer than its delivery daemon receives the old reply shape. That is refused with a
  message naming the mismatch rather than silently accepted, and each daemon's own renewal timer
  remains the adoption backstop.

  A rail that reports no responder is no longer read as an absent daemon on its own. The manager
  settles that outcome from the lease row too: a row naming a holder while the rail answers
  nothing is undetermined and refuses (a live daemon went unanswered, which must not certify a
  remint), a row the manager cannot read refuses the same fail-closed way, and only an absent or
  holderless row reads absent, the state that lets a manager without a bound daemon still take
  renewal ownership.

### Minor Changes

- 104921c: Let remote user-auth managers renew registration executors and recover stopped or frozen manager registrations through host-scoped eviction and guarded reconciliation.

### Patch Changes

- d1f9703: Supervise of a registered remote user-auth space no longer composes or validates local trust under remote authority. A root hosting an unrelated static space's trust records beside the participant sign-in used to fail with a corrupt-bundle refusal; the manager now consults the store only for the supervised space's own records (account record, or a legacy bundle naming the space), refusing that combination of authorities while other tenants' records are never used. An unreadable record on a key that is read refuses loud with the store's own parse message.

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ee8eef: Let a workflow-spawned seat answer an ask or escalated checkpoint addressed to its own incarnation with its baseline credential. `run-answer` is now self-targeted, the manager checks the caller against the pending relay before writing an answer, connector turn text renders the hosted command without `--by`, and that literal command reuses the managed seat's issued caller identity. Other seats, unrelayed checkpoints, other runs, and run start or resume remain refused. Fixes #1877.
- 5b2c19f: Let hosted workflow runs resolve an existing absolute working directory on the selected manager and launch the placed seat in its canonical path.

### Patch Changes

- c44aaf8: Show a settled workflow pause's accepted answer and attribution in the run journal.
- e064fa2: The manager's reap line now says which door stopped a seat and who asked: a requested stop names the authenticated requesting principal (`at u_alice.actor's request`), a self-stop, a recursive reap (naming the parent that left) and a manager shutdown each render their own sentence, and the shutdown teardown — which previously printed no line at all — now logs one line per seat. The former combined `this manager stopped it (despawn or shutdown)` text is gone. Refs #1423
- cf5a5cb: The renewal record is per-space: `renewalRecordPath(root, space)` now writes and reads `.cotal/renewal.<spaceKey>.json`, keyed by the same injective hex the pidfiles use, and every writer and reader threads the space — the manager's renewal pass, `doctor auth --fix`'s write, `doctor auth`'s verdict reads, and `status --components`' delivery row. Before, one root-scoped `.cotal/renewal.json` served every space at a root, so with two spaces co-resident the last pass won: a refused adoption in one space was reported as accepted once the other's manager ran a clean pass, and the mirror case reddened a healthy space's doctor. A root-only `renewal.json` left by a pre-per-space build names no space and is never read as any space's verdict; `doctor auth` names it as a leftover with its cleanup, and `cotal clean all` removes it beside the per-space record. Fixes #1850.
- 09fa8d8: Importing the manager package no longer compiles its service contracts at module scope. Every CLI invocation loads the module before its verb is read (`bin/run.ts` self-registers the manager surface), and the eager Ajv compile of all 41 distinct schema roots cost ~1.8 CPU-seconds paid by `cotal --version` (#1323; an empty node process costs ~28 ms). Command pairs now compile on first access — `managerCommandDefs` materializes the full table at serve registration, where the validators are needed and a compile failure surfaces with the same error class as before — and the §13.7 cluster document derives each command's digests from the source schema through the same member-free manifest construction the profile uses, so all digests stay byte-identical and describe-only readers never compile. `MANAGER_CONTRACTS`, `MANAGER_STATUS_CONTRACT`, and every other export keep their names and types. Measured on a built tree: `cotal --version` median CPU 1.819 s -> 0.867 s; the contract module's import cost 739 ms -> ~200 ms wall (the remainder is the core/cli import graphs, unchanged). Refs #1323.

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 64d723e: Enable the AG-UI event plane by default for connectors that publish one. Operators and peer spawns
  can opt out explicitly, while connectors without an event plane refuse unless that opt-out is set.
- ec8649b: Preserve the closed required-events registration policy and enforce it across discovery, launch,
  grant coverage, direct connector sessions, and trusted upgrades of existing manual registrations.

### Patch Changes

- 7bd1ce8: Add `cotal service` (install/status/uninstall): run the manager as a user service that survives logout and reboot. Linux installs a systemd user unit per mesh, macOS a launchd agent; other platforms fail with a message naming what is missing. The unit runs a bare `supervise` with mesh facts in a 0600 EnvironmentFile, a private COTAL_HOME (with the mesh registry entry snapshotted into it), and connectors pre-seeded synchronously by the installer. `supervise` reads COTAL_SPACE/COTAL_SERVER from the environment when the flags are absent, and pins its workspace root so a unit's WorkingDirectory owns the pidfiles.

  Every path-derived value the unit writes (WorkingDirectory, EnvironmentFile, ExecStart tokens) is escaped for systemd percent specifiers, so a mesh root containing `%` starts over its real path instead of a path systemd rewrote while install reported success. Uninstall and status require the unit's recorded mesh to be present (and, for uninstall, to match the named mesh); a unit that carries the provenance marker but no recorded mesh is refused rather than treated as the requested mesh.

- 92a8938: Run a manual registration's policy refresh where the policy is consumed. The refresh reached the
  pinned exchange from the command dispatcher, ahead of every command's own refusals, so `cotal status`
  on a pre-policy manual entry failed on a transport error and `cotal supervise` reported that error
  instead of its `--server` mismatch or missing-login sentence. Spawn, join and supervise now refresh
  after their local refusals; read-only commands never refresh. The bundle validator, the pinned fetch
  and the dial classifier move to `@cotal-ai/workspace` so the manager can share them.
- f50e20d: Restore an admitted seat checkpoint on the destination, before the preserved resume starts.

  A destination used to admit a checkpoint and then launch the seat against whatever happened to be at `launch.cwd`. The captured bundle, the two diffs and the untracked archive were written, digested and admitted, and nothing consumed them. `cotal up` now puts those bytes back, as a step of the preserved-resume path that runs after every gate has passed over every checkpoint and before a single writer generation is claimed, so a refusal costs nothing for the same reason a gate failure does.

  Each seat stages beside its own `cwd`. Every recorded digest is verified again over the files as they are now; the bundle is cloned into `<cwd>.incoming`, refused when that path already exists; the recorded base commit is verified in the clone and checked out detached; the index diff is applied with `--index` and the worktree diff without it, both `--binary --allow-empty`; the untracked archive is extracted. Every seat stages before any seat is promoted, and promotion moves an existing `cwd` aside to `<cwd>.superseded.<timestamp>` before renaming the staging directory into place. Those two renames are the only steps that touch the path the seat will use, so a failure anywhere leaves every seat's live `cwd` as it was, promotes nothing and claims no generation. `git` and `tar` run as child processes with argument arrays, never a shell string.

  The superseded name is claimed before anything moves, by exclusive directory create, with a numeric suffix when the name is taken. The timestamp has one-second resolution, so two promotions of the same seat within one second would otherwise compute the same path, and the second rename would either replace the tree the first one saved or fail on it. A name this step could not create is a name it does not use.

  A leftover `<cwd>.incoming` refuses by name and is never removed automatically: a staging directory from a failed run is the only record of what failed, so an operator inspects it and removes it by hand. A pre-existing `cwd` is renamed rather than deleted, so a wrong checkpoint costs a rename instead of a tree.

  The promoted tree is verified once more. A checkpoint now records the seat's `git status --porcelain` as the cut read it, under the same selection rule the untracked set was produced under, and the restore re-reads it in the promoted tree and refuses a difference. Both applies can return 0 and still leave an index the source did not have, and this is the only check that sees it.

  The session files travel the same way. The manager's resume entry carries the connector's `sessionStatePath` when the seat has one, `cotal down --preserve-state` takes `--session-store <path>` (repeatable, applied to every continuation-capable retained seat, refused when the path does not exist or is not a directory), and each captured session file records where it lands as an anchor plus a relative path rather than the source host's absolute spelling. The restore places them before the seat launches, so a connector that declares exact continuation is sealed and resumed as `exact` rather than capped. A pointer whose recorded `sessionId` is not the one the retained inventory reopens is refused before anything is cloned, and a session file already present at its destination is judged by content: equal bytes are already restored, different bytes are refused with both digests rather than clobbered.

  `up --restore <dir>` reaches the same admission and the same restore, after the store is restored and validated and before commit intent is journaled. It previously handed a retained inventory to the manager with no gate run, no generation claimed and no restore.

  The incarnation check runs before the restore does. The recorded `lifecycleUid` is reconciled against the inventory the resume is about to hand the manager as a gate over the staged set, so a checkpoint describing a different incarnation refuses with both uids while every live working tree is still in place and no generation has been claimed. That comparison previously ran after admission returned, which is after a tree had been moved aside, another promoted over it and a generation claimed under the checkpoint's uid.

  A restore never moves or replaces the destination's own control directory. A seat whose `cwd` holds a `.cotal/`, the layout an operator gets from running `up` and `spawn` in one directory, is refused before staging: a checkpoint excludes the control directory by design, so promoting a tree that cannot contain it would carry the destination's live trust material and maintenance state away under the superseded tree, and the restore would report success.

  A continuity class of `exact` or `fork` now requires the pointer and at least one store file. A pointer alone names a session whose transcript the artifact does not hold, and it is capped like a cut carrying neither.

- c18c055: A manager whose boot inventory has no available connector no longer takes unpinned `spawn` or `launch` on the class `one` rail. Those commands stay on scatter and on this instance's `inst` rail, so a sibling that can launch them can win the queue, and a caller that pins this instance still gets a named harness refusal. `describe` still lists the commands. Manager `status` reports `classSpawn` for that skip (cluster revision 15). A partial inventory keeps the class rail; a harness refusal there names `--on`, because the standing serve credential cannot read sibling inventories.

### Minor Changes

- 6f248ac: Enumerate broker spawn sites so an unmigrated suite fails the gate instead of leaking

  The reaper claims a leaked `nats-server` by matching the store-dir token in its argv, and its header
  states the standing condition: it "is only ever as complete as the migration that mints the token".
  #1008 measured what that costs, 108 orphaned brokers on one box in a day, all holding loopback ports
  inside the OS ephemeral range that suites draw from. The five suites it named were migrated, and
  nothing was left behind that could notice the sixth.

  `pnpm smoke:broker-migration` is that missing piece. It names no filenames: it walks `git ls-files`,
  finds every call that starts a `nats-server`, and fails when one is not claimable by the reaper or
  killable by the teardown helper. A suite added next week is in the population on the commit that
  adds it. The census currently reads 319 spawn sites across 297 files, and the gate checks all 315
  that are in scope.

  The census found 98 unadopted sites, not five. Two conditions each break the chain on their own and
  both are now required: the token has to be in a path the broker is STARTED with, since the reaper
  reads argv and nothing else, and the handle has to reach `teardownOnSignal`, since the token only
  helps once the owner is dead. Three shapes were leaking for reasons a named list would never have
  surfaced. A suite minting a tokened store dir but launching with `-c <conf>` put the token somewhere
  argv never carries, so it was unclaimable despite looking migrated. Brokers started with neither
  `-sd` nor `-c` left no evidence at all; those now pass a tokened `-sd` purely as a marker, which
  `nats-server` accepts without JetStream and writes nothing into. And suites that owned one broker
  while leaving a sibling unowned read as clean under any file-level check, so ownership is decided per
  spawn site.

  A deliberate negative control opts out with a `SMOKE_BROKER_UNADOPTED_OK` marker, which is greppable
  and per-site rather than a silent exclusion: `reaper.smoke.ts` must be able to start an untokened
  broker, since that is the case it exists to detect.

  The teardown helper no longer stalls three seconds and then reports a false alarm on every green
  run. It waited on `process.kill(pid, 0)`, which keeps succeeding for a child that has been killed but
  not yet waited on, so a suite whose own `finally` kills the broker first left a zombie that read as
  alive until the deadline elapsed, and the helper then printed `did not exit before path cleanup`
  about a process that was already dead. Liveness now distinguishes a zombie from a running process,
  and a genuinely running broker is still waited on before its store dir is removed.

- 4ab8b4b: Serve a space from more than one manager, with one renewal owner

  A manager whose workspace root differed from the delivery daemon's was refused at construction, so
  an auth-mode space could only ever have one manager. A participant machine could not run a manager
  for a space it had joined, and a second manager on one machine from another checkout could not start
  either.

  The store-identity proof stays and still runs before every remint, but a divergent answer now
  decides ownership rather than admission. That alone is not enough: the comparison is pure equality
  with no holder and no tiebreak, so every manager sharing one store passes it, and two owners
  reminting on independent timers have no ordering between them. One write then lands between the
  other's re-sign and its fingerprint-only `reloadCreds`, which is the adoption refusal the proof
  exists to prevent.

  Ownership therefore requires both the identity match and a per-space renewal lease, one
  CAS-acquired key in the manager bucket. The lease is kept alive against that bucket's TTL and
  claimed before the first remint, because that remint re-signs through the store and on a slow store
  outlasts the TTL by itself. A holder that dies has its lease expire so a survivor takes over with no
  operator step, and a clean stop hands it back at once. A manager that owns neither condition starts,
  serves its seats, skips the remint, and writes no renewal record because it re-signed nothing.

### Patch Changes

- 58f0e2d: Strip every COTAL\_ key from the environment the #1649 acceptance harnesses hand their children

  Both acceptance harnesses spread the ambient environment into a child process. Whatever runs
  them may be a managed agent session, so that spread can hand the child a live credential and a
  live broker URL. `smoke:suite-ambient-env` reported both files and was red on main.

  The e2e harness did strip, but from a hand-enumerated list of four keys, which only covers the
  names someone thought of at the time. It now drops them by prefix, and still sets the two keys
  it needs afterwards. The other harness had no strip at all and now drops them at module scope,
  because a scrub inside the function that performs the spread is a promise about execution order
  rather than a fact about what the child can inherit.

- 83ab007: Refuse a reap that could not read its custody record, instead of reporting it as a reaped seat.

  `absent` says the record was unreadable, which is a fact about addressability rather than liveness. A custodian that dies after spawning its child and before writing the record leaves a live seat and no record, and so does a stale reference. Both of the manager's rendering sites turned that into "already forgotten" and carried on, so a successor could free an alias while the seat was still running. The refusal now lives in `requireRuntimeReap`, so `absent` cannot reach a caller at all.

- 254f5da: Submit seat input on the call that sends it. `input` wrote the text and its carriage return as one pty write, so a TUI harness read the return as the last character of the text rather than as the submit key: the text waited in the composer and the next call's return submitted the previous call's text. The return is now written on its own, and the text is delivered as a bracketed paste (`ESC[200~ … ESC[201~`) in slices under the pty's 4096-byte input buffer. The paste markers matter on their own: a TUI classifies a fast burst of input as a paste and consumes the newline that trails it, so a text long enough to need more than one write stayed one call behind even with the return written alone. Measured on a real seat, texts of 120 and 700 bytes were submitted on their own call while 2500 and 3100 bytes were not; with the paste framing, 120, 2600 and 5912 bytes each submit on the call that sends them. The markers are framing rather than content, so the reported byte count still covers only the text and its return.

### Minor Changes

- b0aeca4: Make bare `cotal down` and `Manager.stop()` spare managed agents by default. Use
  `cotal down --with-agents` or `Manager.stop({ withAgents: true })` for deliberate destructive
  teardown. Linux PTY seats release manager-local proxy custody while their detached custodians and
  child processes continue running, and the CLI binds destructive intent to the exact live stop
  attempt so an interrupted command cannot poison a later bare shutdown. Managers launched before
  process identity pins existed remain stoppable after the documented reduced-guarantee warning:
  bare down cannot prove which SIGTERM handler that running binary carries, so it never reports the
  pre-signal seat inventory as confirmed spared. A genuinely older destructive handler may still reap
  those agents. `--with-agents` uses a one-shot handoff bound to the manager pid and the live
  stop-reservation inode, then signals unconditionally.
- 18f3df0: Validate retained remote managed agents through the authenticated host authority service

  Remote supervisors now send the retained actor token and sentinel credential only to the manager
  authority route derived from the verified exchange origin. The host fresh-checks the interactive
  operator's `supervise` grant, the host-authenticated current manager registration proof, the open
  gate and serving epoch, the target owner, and the current retained managed row. It returns only the
  non-secret authority shape.

  The manager requires the host-issued activation receipt and independently binds every response
  coordinate and authority field to the retained inventory. Missing, malformed, substituted, stale,
  redirected, cross-origin, and widened responses fail closed.

- cf6ced5: Make `cotal input` wait for the target runtime to acknowledge the PTY write before printing its byte receipt. Custodial and in-process PTY writes now return the accepted UTF-8 byte count or reject, and the manager refuses missing, partial, or failed acknowledgements with an error that names the seat. A dropped write therefore exits non-zero without a `sent` receipt instead of claiming delivery from the intended buffer.
- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.
- c9ea091: Reclaim an endpoint governance slot left held by a stopped registration

  An instance that stopped between taking the endpoint governance slot and publishing its spec left
  the slot held with no registration behind it, and every later registration for that endpoint
  refused while nothing was actually in flight. Neither documented recovery reached it:
  `cotal reconcile-gate` reopens the holder's issuance gate and does not write the slot, and
  `cotal deregister-instance` has no registration to remove.

  `registerServiceInstance` now decides whether a foreign-held slot is abandoned instead of refusing
  unconditionally. A slot is reclaimable only when the holder's issuance gate has reopened past the
  generation the slot is stamped with, which proves the hold can never be promoted, since a promote
  requires that same generation still frozen. The holder's gate is read through a new optional
  `observeHolderGeneration` seam, mirroring `deregisterServiceInstance`'s `observeGeneration`, and
  `readEndpointGateGeneration` is exported for callers to wire it. The manager wires it over the
  auth-bucket read its existing registration credential already holds. No new grant and no new writer:
  the registration path remains the governance head's only writer.

  Everything else still refuses, and the refusals are the point. A slot whose holder's gate is still
  at the stamped generation is a live registration and is never taken. An absent seam, an unreadable
  gate, a garbled generation, and an observation behind the stamp all refuse. The conflict message
  now names a remedy that reaches the state rather than one that does not.

  SPEC §13.7 states the liveness guarantee this closes: a registration that stops before its spec
  publication must not block an endpoint's registrations permanently, the abandoned determination
  must rest on durable facts rather than a liveness probe, and an implementation that cannot make it
  must refuse.

- 6fd855f: Add a target-pinned hosted manager retirement phase that preserves host release ordering, uses the existing crash-resumable auth barrier, bounds activation to the canonical contract artifacts, and keeps remote manager maintenance on fresh host-owned admin authorization without copying host ledger state to participants.
- dd6fea0: The seat record pins the custodian's and the child's process start identity, and a new `reapSeat` signals only a process whose identity matches. It also pins the boot those pids belong to: a start token counts ticks since boot, so a record that outlived a reboot names pids that now belong to other processes, and such a record is refused rather than signalled. The manager records each seat's custody reference on its static slot and, when a successor terminalizes a crashed manager's lifecycle, reaps the orphaned seat process through the runtime's custody `reap` before retiring the lifecycle. A runtime without it refuses by name and the lifecycle stays held. The custody reference is reserved before the seat is launched and rides the slot's first durable row, so a manager that dies between the launch and the slot activation still leaves a seat its successor can address; `Runtime.spawn` takes that reserved reference and must honour it. The same reference rides the rollback object a failed spawn hands its `finally`, so a manager that launched a seat and then threw reaps it in-process instead of retiring the lifecycle and freeing the alias over a running seat. Every seat id is checked against the shape `seatId` mints before it is joined to the custody root, so a forged reference is refused rather than resolved to a path outside it.

  `reserve` and `reap` are NOT on the core `Runtime` contract. They live on a manager-local `CustodialRuntime` that the built-in pty runtime implements, because a backend that delegates to an external surface (`tmux`, `cmux`, `orca`, `herdr`) owns no process to signal and no custody record to pre-mint against, so the methods would have no meaning for it rather than merely no implementation. `adopt` stays on the generic contract.

  The two crash scenarios and the in-process rollback are three suites, `smoke:orphan-seat-reap`, `smoke:orphan-seat-spawn-window` and `smoke:orphan-seat-rollback`, because one command carrying them crossed the mutation-proof command timeout.

- b00f3c1: Refuse a two-root daemon-credential composition at construction. The manager challenges the delivery daemon's reload-store identity before the first remint, and the refusal names both stores. Fingerprint-only reloadCreds stays once both sides read one SecretStore. A store declares its authority identity, or an injected adapter names its coordinate in COTAL_SECRET_STORE on both processes.

### Patch Changes

- 9a334ae: Honor connector-declared startup confirmation prompts in PTY seats by matching normalized terminal output, pressing Enter only when the prompt appears, and failing with a named bounded error when it does not.
- 9ff5c22: Make the first manager identity on a fresh root an exclusive create. Of N concurrent starts, exactly one process mints the instance file and the others adopt that identity or refuse with a named error, so they cannot take two leases.
- 0a3e58a: `MAX_AGENTS` is declared once, exported from `resume.ts`, and imported by `manager.ts`. The two private copies (spawn/resume capacity checks and the resume inventory schema's array cap) could drift apart silently: raising the ceiling in `manager.ts` left resume inventories refused above 50 with a zod length error that never mentioned capacity. A derived smoke walks the production manager source tree and proves there is exactly one definition and that both consumers acquire it.
- 062881a: Wire `--max-sessions` from the CLI into the manager's live-session ceiling.

  `ManagerOptions.maxSessions` was documented as deployment-configurable, but nothing in the CLI
  could set it, so every live manager sat at 64. `cotal supervise --max-sessions` and
  `cotal up --max-sessions` now parse a positive integer, pass it into the manager, and record it on
  the mesh so a same-root repair, resume, or `spawn -f` that restarts the manager does not silently
  drop a raised ceiling. A refresh of an already-running manager refuses a different `--max-sessions`
  rather than recording an unapplied setting. A capacity refusal names `--max-sessions`. Default
  remains 64. Size for agents × panes: the browser console opens one session per pane.

- 159c5f0: Merge a complete agent file passed as a cotal_persona prompt into one frontmatter block. Authored channel grants, role, and agent survive load, explicit tool arguments win, and a malformed leading fence is refused rather than wrapped.
- 5079c89: Rebind a presence watch that goes silent under a live connection, and stop `cotal ps` from printing a liveness verdict while the manager's own presence view is stale.

  On netcup on 2026-09-09 the presence stream was deleted and recreated while the manager kept its
  connection. Its ordered consumer re-created itself from the old cursor against a stream whose
  sequence had restarted, the broker kept sending it idle heartbeats, and nothing ever re-created the
  watch. The manager's roster froze at the pre-recreation snapshot for hours: `cotal ps` printed
  `mesh offline` for every seat older than the freeze and `not in roster` for every seat younger,
  while a fresh observer saw all of them heartbeating. The lane watchdog stopped a working
  orchestrator twice on that reading.

  The endpoint's sweep already refused to age peers out while the whole bucket was silent and marked
  the view stale; that was the right verdict for a held link and the wrong end state for a dead
  consumer. When the view is stale and the transport is up, the endpoint now stops the old watch and
  binds a new one from the bucket's current state, once per liveness window, and reports the rebind
  as a warning that names the silent interval. The per-peer age-out also requires that the watch
  delivered for a full window after the peer's last heartbeat, so an observer's own deafness no longer
  emits one offline verdict per peer on the tick before the whole-bucket gate trips. A rebind that
  is still awaiting the broker when the endpoint stops or rebuilds its connection is retired: it
  installs nothing and reports nothing, so a stopped endpoint never regains a watch and a rebuilt
  one keeps the watch its fresh connection bound. A rebind that lands on a bucket with no keys is
  read two ways. An observer that does not register (a probe) learns that nobody is present: it
  retires every peer still in its roster and holds the view current until the first write, instead of
  reading its own silence as staleness and rebinding once per window while the mesh is empty. An
  observer that registers (the manager) is one of the missing keys, so the bucket was wiped since its
  last heartbeat: it re-publishes its own record, the new watch delivers it, and every other peer is
  re-observed or aged out from that delivery. It never marks itself offline on a current view.

  Each `ps` row now carries the manager's presence-view state (`meshView`: `current`, `stale`, or
  `unpopulated`), and the CLI prints `mesh unknown` with the reason instead of `mesh offline` or
  `not in roster` whenever that state is not `current`. Rows from an older manager carry no field and
  render as before.

### Minor Changes

- e6d3c96: Split Linux PTY ownership out of the manager worker: a one-shot launcher starts one detached custodian process per seat, and `Runtime.adopt` returns a live proxy over a permissioned Unix socket. Off Linux, pty spawn stays in-process and `adopt` throws a named custody-transport error.

### Patch Changes

- cf294e7: Settle pending wait-exit after a real child exit, drop the redundant handle catch, keep launch-failed when backlog throws on a closed attach stream, bound manager control-rail disconnects after a broker exit, refresh the bundled custody docs, and grade ci-ok as the sole always-running aggregate plus both pack polarities.
- 8ec22cb: `cotal supervise` on a registered remote mesh now dials the broker URL the registry actually
  holds. A remote broker is commonly published over a `wss://` edge, and the manager-authority
  registration the supervisor runs first handed that URL to the raw node transport, which refuses a
  websocket URL outright, so supervision stopped before a manager was ever constructed. That
  registration and every other control dial this audit found can be handed a registry server URL now
  select the transport from the scheme, including the planes `cotal run --local` opens, which failed
  on such a mesh for the same reason. The registration also carries the record's TLS requirement
  instead of assuming a plaintext broker, so a participant no longer downgrades its prepare
  credential exchange on a mesh the registry describes as TLS-required. On the same path, the cluster
  artifacts the registration reads back are now looked up by the key form the content-addressed store
  uses, which a remote registration reached with a prefixed digest reference and could not resolve.

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.
- 18a0024: The manager hosts workflow runs. `run-start`, `run-resume`, `run-answer`, `run-status` and
  `run-ps` are served on the manager's endpoint rails; a run is validated before anything is
  recorded, driven in the manager's process under a per-run `run-driver` credential, and taken back
  from its journal after a manager restart. `cotal run` is a client of that surface by default,
  with `--local` keeping the in-process drive, now under the run's own `run-driver` and
  `run-operator` credentials rather than `admin`; an answer's writes are pinned to the one pause it
  answers. A user-auth mesh refuses the family by name until a run can carry its user's owner. A new `run` capability mints the family into an
  agent's credential and injects the `cotal_run` tool, so an agent can write a cotal-lang program
  and start it from a session. `run-answer` records the answerer from the caller's credential and
  takes no `by`; `cotal run answer` drops `--by` on the hosted path. `spawn({ supervise })` is a restart policy the manager enforces in
  place: `{ restarts, window? }` (default `10m`) until the budget is spent, then the seat is
  retired and the next `turn` is L4002. A policy this host cannot honour is refused at accept.
- e986173: Make manager `inspect` distinguish a stranded static slot from an unknown name through structured durable-state details, and make `attach` stop reconnecting when those details show the seat is gone.

### Minor Changes

- 38d7bb7: Record a durable cleanup-complete marker on a terminalizing static managed slot before the final CAS to `retired`. A `terminalizing` row was previously consistent with three worlds (cleanup not started, cleanup in flight, or cleanup completed with the process dead before the CAS) that the state could not tell apart, so a resumed terminal always re-ran `cleanup()` as the only total option and the row could never assert cleanup was already done. `runStaticTerminal` now runs the footprint cleanup through one at-most-once helper that writes `cleanupComplete: true` on the `terminalizing` slot before the `retired` CAS; a resumed terminal reads it and skips a completed cleanup. The marker distinguishes the cleanup-completed world from the not-known-complete worlds (which keep the same remedy: re-run the idempotent cleanup) and adds no unrecoverable intermediate state.

### Minor Changes

- 890d08a: Complete a committed registration spec after a lost ack instead of freezing a new coordinate. Boot self-heal and `cotal reconcile-gate` now finish that same freeze when the spec advanced, and abort-reopen only on a definite no-commit.
- e5412a1: Add per-agent `cwd` to mesh manifests. Relative paths resolve on the manager host against its workspace, matching the imperative spawn option. The directory survives launch-spec validation and contributes to stale-entry detection without changing hashes for manifests that omit it.

  This implements the working-directory part of #963. Manifest session continuity remains separate work.

- 7ff0c21: Hold the endpoint governance slot through Phase-4 reopen so a concurrent deregister cannot delete the spec a registration is still completing. `deregisterServiceInstance` now requires an observe-only read of this instance's issuance-gate generation: matching the held slot is `registration-in-flight`; a slot behind that generation is a leftover after reopen and does not block.

### Patch Changes

- 42b1fce: A late `turn-yield` after the deadline deny has committed is told the turn ended `failed`, never `not-found`.

  The deny itself held: first-terminal-wins still refused a success over it. What failed was the diagnostic. `commitTurnDeadline` deletes the pending entry (its idempotency latch) _before_ the terminal CAS, then remembers the settled answer only after. A yield in that window, or after a concurrent sweep dropped `turnAcceptances.settled`, heard `no pending turn` — which a seat reads as an addressing fault, not "the run moved on". The durable terminal is the answer the run already has; the yield now reads it when the in-memory settled field is missing, and the sweep no longer wipes an unsettled acceptance the moment pending is empty.

- 5038519: A leftover turn acceptance whose deadline commit never remembered is aged off `leftoverSince` (when the pending latch dropped), not off the original deadline.

  Aging off `deadlineAt` would prune a long-outage leftover on the first sweep tick and take the GoalRef a late yield still needs. `commitTurnDeadline` stamps that clock when it deletes pending.

- 42635d2: Re-anchor the late-yield mutation `find` on the durable-read code block, not the neighbouring comment.

  `smoke:mutation-fixtures` refuses a `find` that spans prose. The #1265 guard used three comment lines to make the window unique; a comment-only tidy would have disarmed it silently. The durable `readGoalResult` block is unique on its own.

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- a87709c: Every cotal-lang effect now performs on the mesh: the durable-action group is built end to end and
  the not-yet-durable seam is gone.

  `spawn` submits a real manager goal and returns the allocated seat's handle, and meters the
  agent's `permits` (`turns`, `wallClock`; the turn that would exceed one is L4001, and a budget the
  host cannot meter is refused at spawn); `conclave` opens a scoped sub-team as durable membership
  rows; `ask` parks schema-checked pauses answered through `cotal run answer` and tells the agent
  over the turn relay, one relay per attempt carrying the schema, the attempt and the previous
  refusal, which every connector's intake renders with the answer command; `monitor` registers the
  handle on its journal entry and `wait(down)` reads a monitored incarnation's death off presence
  liveness, refusing an agent nobody monitored.
  `turn` rides a new pull-shaped manager relay: the manager serves `turn` (targeted, the
  despawn/input reach) plus `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` (self reach, manager contract revision
  10), holds the payload on the goal-index note, pins the goal to the seat's incarnation, and denies
  at a goal-bound deadline hold; the seat side (all connectors) pulls pending turns, surfaces them
  two-phase into host context, auto-yields `done` when the host turn ends, and yields `blocked` or
  `handoff` through the new `cotal_yield` tool; the run client renders context with pending notices,
  arms its own pause on the acceptance's deadline as the L4003 authority, watches presence as the
  L4002 authority (a death the manager marks on the deadline terminal reads the same way), and
  honors handoffs (L4005/L4004 validation, the `handoffFrom` goal chain); the manager shows a seat
  one turn at a time. The relay holds on an auth mesh: the agent baseline gains the self-mode
  `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` rows, the operator seat-write set (`control-caller-admin`, the
  `admin` capability) gains `turn` beside `input`, and the manager mints the deadline hold's
  schedule over its serve connection and owner-expires the hold once due instead of reading a
  fire it holds no grant for. `wait(replied)` observes the run's own turn terminals as a level, and never a
  turn the run itself ended without an accepted yield. A `spawn` may bind a logical worktree: the
  validator rejects two literal-worktree spawns in one concurrent scope (L3022, named branch
  functions included) and the runtime claims a tree before it submits, refusing a second spawn into
  a tree held by a live seat or by a spawn in flight (L4008), with sequential reuse the moment the
  holder's presence lapses. A spawn refused at accept is L4000 (L4001 for seat capacity) and one
  whose seat never came up is L4002; an `ask` whose deadline passes with no conforming record is
  L4006; a fork copies a spawn that said `onFork: "adopt"` and refuses one that would have to
  respawn (L5019). The run driver re-issues
  recorded-but-undischarged cancellations at adoption, so recovery does not wait for completion to
  release a dead loser's seat, pause, or tree. A migration's `--adopt <handle>` hands the orphaned
  seat to the edited program's next spawn of that persona, and `--release <handle>` despawns it at
  commit through the run's own discharge; both name the agent the step spawned, and a spawn that
  produced none is an orphan like a sleep; the adopting spawn binds the orphaned spawn's goal as
  its own, so a resume re-reads the seat and a cancellation despawns it. A turn accept the manager
  cannot finish unwinds to a failed terminal on its bound goal, and a retry of it is refused naming
  that terminal. The delivery daemon hosts the checkpoint timer writer, so mediated deadlines fire
  with no suite pump.

### Patch Changes

- e7687e7: fix(manager): schedule credential renewal so a tick lands inside `[renewAt, exp)` for any TTL

  The manager scheduled `renewDaemonCreds` every `STANDING_RENEWABLE_TTL_SEC / 2`, so on a 24h
  credential the ticks landed at 12h (`healthy`, no-op) and 24h (`expired`, session already
  refused). `inspectCredHealth` enters `near-expiry` at 75% of iat-to-exp lifetime, so the renewal
  window is only TTL/4 wide, and an interval of TTL/2 can miss it entirely for any TTL. The
  manager's own daemon credential died on that ~24h cadence, as reported at 0.37.0.

  The interval is now `credRenewIntervalMs(ttlSeconds) = max(1ms, TTL/4·1000)`, derived from the
  caller's TTL. Ticks TTL/4 apart guarantee at least one lands in every `[renewAt, exp)` window
  regardless of TTL, so both the 24h `STANDING_RENEWABLE_TTL_SEC` and the 30-day
  `ROTATION_RENEWED_TTL_SEC` are covered without a hardcoded number. The renewal pass is unchanged
  and idempotent, so a tick that fires before the window costs one health check per owner. Both
  scheduling sites (initial start and preservation abort) are updated together.

  Covered by `smoke:manager-renewal-boundary`, a real-broker cell that drives the compressed-ratio
  (TTL=20s) boundary and asserts the schedule reissues inside the window, with an in-probe mutant
  that reverts to TTL/2 to prove the cell reddens when the fix is reverted.

### Minor Changes

- e5e68ed: Add a mesh-side persona catalog read (`cotal_personas` / manager `list-personas` + `show-persona`) so a spawn-capable agent can enumerate names and show a card it owns without shelling out.
- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.
- 9021896: Make the runtime pid/log namespace per-space. The manager and delivery daemon now record themselves
  as `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.pid`, `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.log`,
  `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.delivery-aware`, `.cotal/delivery.<spaceKey>.pid` and
  `.cotal/delivery.<spaceKey>.log`, through the same `{space}` expansion `auth-service.<spaceKey>.pid`
  already used. The five names were root-scoped constants, so one workspace root hosted one manager and
  one delivery daemon by filename: a second space booting in the same root overwrote the first space's
  record, and every reader of that file then answered about the wrong process. `status`, `down`, `up`,
  `clean` and `spawn -f` take the space they are answering about.

  Existing single-space meshes keep working across the upgrade. Reads admit a pre-segmentation
  root-scoped record while it is the only spelling present, byte-exact, so a `cotal down` still finds
  and stops a daemon started by the previous build instead of orphaning it. Writes are always the
  canonical space-keyed name, and each start reclaims a provably dead pre-upgrade record first, so an
  ordinary upgrade does not leave both spellings behind. A live pre-upgrade daemon is refused rather
  than overwritten, and both spellings present is reported as ambiguous rather than guessed.

  A folder-wide command reads its space off the runtime records the folder holds. `resolveRuntimeSpace`
  decodes the space out of the record filenames and prefers a space whose record is running over dead
  residue; two spaces running under one root throws and names both. The previous read came from the
  `.cotal/auth` account records, which an open mesh (`broker: { auth: false }`) never writes, so a bare
  `cotal down` in such a folder answered with the default space and walked past its own manager once the
  records became space-keyed.

  `MANAGER_PIDFILE` and `MANAGER_DELIVERY_AWARE_MARKER` move from `pid.ts` to `local-process.ts` and
  are now `{space}` templates; both are still exported from the package index. `RESERVED_COTAL_CHILDREN`
  no longer lists the five root-scoped runtime names.

### Patch Changes

- 9b6073f: Scope the static terminal's verified broker eviction to the credential ledger's holder principals. A lifecycle that never minted a credential retires without demanding an oracle for a principal that was never issued, while a non-empty holder set still fail-closes until every named principal is verified gone.
- 7e45495: Make every shipped endpoint consumer explicitly surface or ignore recoverable warnings so retry and renewal failures no longer disappear silently.
- e703873: Report connector harness availability at manager boot and expose resolved binary paths in status.
- e6c6947: Prevent two broker owners during manager succession. Normal shutdown now requires authoritative seat exit proof before releasing manager authority, and crash recovery verify-evicts an orphaned static seat's broker principal before retiring its lifecycle and freeing the alias.
- 3cc980d: Resume an interrupted frozen endpoint-gate repair without repeating holder evictions that were
  already verified. Progress is durably bound to the registration operation, frozen-gate revision,
  and sorted holder set, while every retry still rechecks freeze-holder liveness. A mismatch restarts
  from zero, each completion is persisted before the next verification, and the gate reopens only
  after every current holder verifies. The endpoint executor can write only its exact repair key, and
  post-reopen cleanup failure cannot authorize a later freeze.
- 0d45f44: Reached manager-surface smokes read count, revision, and names from the shipped cluster document. The resolve-rtt probe asserts injected-wait occupancy, not wall-clock versus count times RTT.
- d94b617: Keep synchronous spawn callers waiting through the connector-selected readiness budget instead of timing out early on slow healthy launches.
- 17046ac: Spawn failures return the lifecycle facts the manager already had (blocked op, head state, opId, remedy) instead of a connector timeout or opaque string.

## 0.36.0

### Patch Changes

- 7c5995b: Key per-tenant material per space instead of per root. The five root-scoped kinds (the `$SYS` cred pair, `membership.json`, `membership-rw.creds`, `delivery.creds`) and every per-agent standing secret now live under `space.<hex>/` segments, migrated on first touch through one choke point that refuses — loudly, with an honest remedy — on any root it cannot show to hold a single tenant. `space rm`'s step-7 reaps land with their step-1 preconditions ahead of the verb itself. Also: the delivery daemon's `$SYS` repair advice now asks the guard instead of printing commands that refuse on the roots that need them, expired user bearers stop being re-presented on reconnect (with the retry bounded), and `agentSecretKeyForFile` takes the caller's space and checks the recorded path against it, so a stored path can no longer address another tenant's material.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 22c3182: Honor the persona file's `agent:` frontmatter when picking the spawn harness. The key existed in
  half the fleet's personas but no code path read it: it swept into the verbatim `meta` bag, and both
  launch paths resolved the connector before the persona file was loaded, so `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT`
  silently beat a deliberate per-persona pin (a `jcode` persona ran `claude` with no complaint).

  The harness now resolves once, on every spawn path, as: explicit `--agent` flag > persona `agent:` >
  `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT` > the product default. That is the precedence `model:` and `variant:` already
  have, keeping the env var a _default_ rather than an override. On `--detach` the CLI now threads
  an explicit flag and the caller's environment default as separate control fields. The manager loads
  the persona file before resolving its connector and applies the same precedence while preserving
  the invoking operator's default when its own environment differs. A pin naming an unregistered
  connector fails the spawn loudly with the connector install hint (no silent fallback).

  `saveAgentFile` round-trips the field, so a runtime `cotal_persona` redefine preserves a pin.
  Docs updated (`agent-files.md`, `connectors.md`, `cli.md`, `config.md`).

Each change of state is one line in `manager.log`. The fail-close that took a manager and every pty seat it held down one tick past the lease TTL is removed, together with the detach-on-lease-loss path it needed. The endpoint also drops its manager-lease KV handle when it rebuilds a closed connection; before, every renew after a reconnect ran on the dead handle and timed out for good.

### Patch Changes

- ffdde4d: Fix the second spawn of any persona being unmintable under per-user auth.

  In user mode the allocated agent name IS the mesh actor, and the principal grammar reserves `-` as
  the separator of the JetStream-name form, so it is rejected inside a token. The spawn auto-numbering
  scheme appended its counter with exactly that character: the second live instance of a persona was
  named `<base>-2` and could never be granted. It numbers with `_` now.

  The failure was invisible outside per-user auth, because static/open mode keys the actor on the
  freshly minted nkey rather than on the name — so it fired only on hosted meshes, only from the
  second spawn onward, and looked like a problem with one persona's name rather than with numbering.

  The name rule itself now lives in one exported predicate (`spawnNameError`) that both the manager's
  name door and the numbering are checked against, and whose narrow half delegates to the shipped
  token validator instead of restating its alphabet. In user mode a name that could never become an
  actor is refused where it is chosen, rather than at mint. Static/open mode keeps the looser rule, so
  an existing `my-agent` persona still spawns across an upgrade.

### Minor Changes

- ba74c84: An agent now reads only the channels it lists. An omitted or empty read set means **no channels**,
  where it previously meant `general`: the agent-file loader, the provisioner, the credential mint and
  the endpoint each defaulted an absent read set to `["general"]`, so any persona that simply did not
  mention channels was subscribed to `general` by code and had the matching channel read row baked
  into its credential.

  An agent on no channel is still a full mesh peer: it appears on the roster and sends and receives
  DMs and anycasts, and the same default-deny that already governed `allowPublish` now governs reads.
  An empty list and an omitted one mean the same thing, for both read keys. That has one consequence
  worth stating plainly: when **both** are omitted, `allowSubscribe` falls back to the read set and so
  resolves empty too, which leaves the agent unable to `cotal_join` a channel at runtime. Give it an
  explicit `allowSubscribe` if it should be able to join one later.

  With no concrete channel there is no default broadcast target, so a send with no explicit channel is
  refused with a message saying so, rather than resolving to `general`. Leaving your last channel is
  allowed and always was; the `cotal_leave` description said otherwise and now says what actually
  happens, including that the default send channel is gone until you join one.

  Migration: **list `general` explicitly if you want it.** A hand-written persona that relied on the
  old default needs `subscribe: [general]` added.

  This changes the default `cotal setup` install as well. The seeded `default_agent` carries
  `subscribe: []`, which used to resolve to `general` and now resolves to no channel; it keeps
  `allowSubscribe: [">"]`, so it can still `cotal_join` anything, it just no longer arrives on a
  channel it never asked for — which is what its own seed comment already described.

  Already-running agents are not narrowed retroactively: a live seat keeps the read ACL its credential
  was minted with, across renewal, until it is respawned.

  **Correction:** the read-set default-deny described above is not new in 0.33.0. It shipped in 0.28.0
  with 86f6b10 (#821, "Remove the implicit `general` channel floor"), and so did the refusal of a send
  with no channel and the no-channel default for the seeded `default_agent`. Upgrading from 0.28.0 or
  later needs no migration for it. What 0.33.0 changed is narrower. The no-default-channel check in
  `multicast` now refuses only an omitted channel (`channel === undefined` where it was `!channel`), so
  an explicit empty-string `channel` is no longer refused as if it were omitted, and the refusal now
  says to name or join a channel. The `cotal_send` and `cotal_leave` tool descriptions and pi's send
  call line no longer name `general` as a default or say the last channel cannot be left, doc comments
  state the rule and the both-keys-omitted consequence, and the `smoke:no-implicit-general` and
  `smoke:session-channels` suites guard it.

The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

### Minor Changes

- 97dea94: A manager that lost its liveness lease hard-stopped every agent it managed and
  deprovisioned each one's credential, durables and broker footprint. Stopping
  serving is the right conclusion on that path; destroying the seats is a separate
  act, and a broker timeout is not a finding about whether an agent should die.
  From the active state the path now detaches: children are left alone, each is
  marked retained so no deprovision call site can select it, and the seats are
  named on the operator channel.

  Two boundaries are unchanged and pinned by cells. Ordinary shutdown (`cotal
down`, Ctrl-C) stays destructive — an operator who asked for a shutdown gets
  one. A maintenance cut that has committed and not finalized still stops its
  children, because that inventory is owed a replay and a successor replaying it
  over live children would spawn a second copy of every seat.

  This does not make a child outlive the manager — a pty child dies with the
  process that spawned it — it removes the manager's deliberate kill and revoke.

- ef01887: Add closed, host-issued remote manager-service authority for registered user-auth participants. It requires the dedicated `supervise` scope, restricts manager registration and credentials to one owner and opaque instance, and uses a lifecycle-bound prepare, activate, and renew flow with fail-closed renewal and same-owner descendant provisioning.

### Patch Changes

- cc1f2e2: `cotal attach` now coalesces rapid wheel input and PTY redraw bursts, waits for local stdout drain
  before returning session credit, and automatically repaints the canonical terminal snapshot after an
  explicit backpressure drop. Session teardown also lets the distinct terminal reason drain before the
  unsequenced close control can overtake it. The bounded 64-frame rail window is unchanged.
- b282f70: Honor a connector's declared startup readiness window and make Jcode provider launch refusals diagnosable without exposing private harness output.
- 0323f5b: The manager logged nothing when a seat left its ownership, on any path. A live
  supervisor lost several seats while it kept running, and because its log carried
  no per-seat exit line, "the supervisor reaped them" and "they died on their own"
  were indistinguishable afterwards — the incident could not be attributed from
  supervisor state at all.

  Every free path now emits one line at `freeSlot`, the single chokepoint they all
  pass through, naming the seat, its lifecycle uid, which path gave up the slot,
  and what the runtime saw when the child ended. The cause is a required argument
  with no default, so a new free path cannot compile without naming itself.

  `AgentHandle` gains an optional `exitInfo()`; the pty runtime stops discarding
  the exit code and signal node-pty already hands it. Absent means UNKNOWN and
  prints as unavailable naming the runtime — a backend that attaches to an
  externally-owned process (tmux/cmux/orca/herdr) cannot see how the child ended,
  and a default of `code 0` there would fabricate a clean exit on precisely the
  seats whose death nobody can explain.

### Minor Changes

- 86f6b10: Remove the implicit `general` channel floor: undeclared access now grants nothing

  An agent that declared no channel access used to fall back to `["general"]` for its
  active read set and read ACL. That floor was applied in seven places — the provisioner,
  the agent-file loader, the manager's spawn path, the CLI's `spawn`, the connector's
  config resolver, and the endpoint's own channel list — so an agent with no frontmatter
  silently joined a channel nobody had granted it.

  The fallback also could not see the credentials it was guessing against. On a manifest
  spawn the materialized persona carries no access frontmatter, so the connector fell back
  to `general` while the minted creds allowed only the manifest's channels; the broker then
  refused the subscription and the agent joined nothing, with no error naming the cause.
  `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE` forwarding was added to paper over exactly this.

  Undeclared read is now empty, matching the repo's no-fallbacks rule and the existing
  default-deny on `allowPublish`. `Endpoint.send()` throws instead of defaulting to
  `general` when the endpoint is on no concrete channel — a caller that never declared a
  channel now gets a loud error rather than a message delivered somewhere it never asked
  for.

  The seeded personas change with it: `default_agent` no longer auto-subscribes to
  `general` and no longer carries a wildcard post ACL (`allowPublish: [">"]` → `[]`,
  default-deny), and the demo personas move to their own `welcome` channel. Channels are
  implicit — created on first use — so no channel provisioning is required.

  Breaking for anyone relying on the implicit floor: an agent that read `general` without
  declaring it must now declare it.

- a84cb62: Saving a persona now requires it to name the channels it reads. `saveAgentFile` refuses a
  definition with no `subscribe`, `cotal personas new` takes a required `--subscribe` (pass
  an empty value for an agent reachable only by direct message and anycast), and a persona
  defined over the wire is created with an empty read set, since that path deliberately
  accepts no policy from its caller, and records that the caller was never offered the
  choice so a reader can tell it apart from a persona whose author chose no channels. Previously a saved persona with no read set inherited
  whatever default was current, so a file could grant a channel its author never chose and a
  later reader could not tell a deliberate silence from a forgotten field. An empty list is
  written rather than filled in, so the two stay distinguishable.

### Patch Changes

- e377c7b: The manager's session signing key now renews itself instead of expiring after a day. It was minted
  once at startup with a flat 24-hour window and the same frozen anchor was returned for the life of
  the process, so any manager with more than a day of uptime lost its session plane permanently: every
  attach failed closed with "outside its validity window", and the only recovery was restarting the
  manager, which kills every live session. Failing closed on an expired key is correct and is
  unchanged; never renewing the key was the defect. The key now rotates once a third of its window has
  elapsed, the previous key stays verifiable for a ten-minute overlap so an artifact signed just
  before a swap is not orphaned, renewal is driven both by a timer and opportunistically before
  signing so a stalled timer alone cannot reintroduce the outage, and the newest key is never dropped.

### Patch Changes

- 3866fdc: Let already-running managed Pi seats adopt crash recovery after an extension reload. Seats launched before the session-state environment variable existed derive the same lifecycle-keyed state path from their manager-owned persona file and lifecycle UID, then record the active Pi session atomically. Fresh managed seats also receive a Pi-native exact session ID before their first turn, so an idle seat is recoverable.
- f339690: Document capability handles as a distinct cost of default environment inheritance, and make two env-boundary suites real gates.

  The configuration guide told operators that `spawn.env` protects secrets living only in the environment, and reassured them that a shell reads `~/.ssh` either way. That understates what inheritance forwards. `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` names a live `ssh-agent` rather than holding a secret, so an inheriting child can ask that agent to sign for any key it holds, and it keeps that power when no private-key file exists on disk at all. The guide now names capability handles as their own class, states the `ssh-agent` case, and records that model-catalog discovery in the `codex` and `opencode` connectors runs the harness with the operator environment and does not consult `spawn.env`.

  The environment-boundary suite asserted that an unenumerated `COTAL_*` sentinel was absent from a spawned child, but never set it in the parent, so the assertion could not fail. The sentinel is now injected, which makes the cell prove the reset is driven by the prefix rather than by the enumerated per-session list. `smoke:hermes-launch-env` and `smoke:env-isolate` are both added to the sharded CI suite list; the hermes suite carries the connector's inherit, reset and both-containment-mode coverage and was previously reachable only through a package-local command.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- a087c2b: A spawned agent now inherits the operator's environment. A harness you installed and configured
  should behave under `cotal spawn` the way it behaves when you run it yourself, and the alternative
  was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors: every new provider needed a change in Cotal
  before it would work through a managed spawn. `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEYS` and the per-connector lists
  that extended it are gone, and Cotal no longer names an inference vendor anywhere in its source.

  Cotal still resets its own `COTAL_*` namespace before the child starts, keeping the machine-wide
  knobs (`COTAL_HOME`, the feedback set, the default-agent pair, the `*_BIN` overrides, the timing
  knobs). That reset is not configurable, because it is identity and not preference: a connector
  supplies the per-session names for each child and does so conditionally, so an inherited value is
  never overwritten and would hand an agent another agent's credential path, ACL, or lifecycle uid.
  The whole prefix is stripped rather than a named list, because which names a connector sets varies
  between connectors and a deny-list only ever names what its author remembered.

  To confine a spawned agent instead, declare `spawn.env` in the cotal config file. The child then
  gets a fixed OS allow-list plus exactly the names you list. An empty array is a real policy meaning
  the OS allow-list alone. Note what this does and does not buy: `HOME` is forwarded either way, so
  an agent with a shell reads `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` regardless, and this protects only secrets that
  live nowhere but the environment.

- 0b602e4: Managed Pi sessions can now fork an existing Pi transcript into the mesh and recover the exact active Pi session after an unexpected process crash. The Pi adapter reports session changes through its authenticated local control endpoint and an owner-only atomic state file; the manager preserves the Cotal identity, lifecycle UID, credentials, children, and durable inbox across up to three restarts in two minutes, then retires a crash loop loudly. Deliberate stops never restart.
- 8e38835: Carry the manager's readiness guidance on an `uncertain` goal terminal. The manager built a
  diagnosis naming the agent and telling the operator to inspect rather than re-issue, then dropped
  it: the terminal committed core's generic "the success signal did not arrive within the readiness
  deadline", which reads as a plain failure and teaches a re-issue, and a re-issue after a launch
  that actually succeeded mints a duplicate agent. `settleGoalUncertain` now accepts an optional
  `reason` the committer supplies, and the manager passes the detail it already constructed; core's
  line remains the fallback for a committer that supplies none.

### Patch Changes

- 3f1ee2f: `cotal ps --wide` / `--json`: surface the per-seat facts the manager already records. The agent row now carries the model pin (and variant), `cwd`, `pid`, spawner, and the owning manager's instance id and host, all optional so an unrecorded fact (no model pinned; a runtime that owns no real process) serializes absent, never fabricated. Bare `ps` output is unchanged; `--wide` prints one dim facts line under each seat; `--json` prints the manager's row verbatim, one object per line, with instance headers on stderr. No new collection path: every field was already held in the manager's spawn-time record.
- b33ba93: A managed agent's retirement is now requested as the manager's SERVE identity, so it is authorized instead of being refused. The auth rail authorizes a `retireLifecycle` request by comparing the caller's `<owner>.<actor>` against the principal bound into the manager's serve issuance gate, and that gate is opened with the serve identity the manager registers with. The request was built from the manager's endpoint identity instead: a second, equally real identity of the same manager, and one the gate can never name. The comparison was therefore unsatisfiable on every user-auth mesh, so every despawn stopped the agent and then had its retirement refused as a full no-op, leaving the name held and the lifecycle un-retired. Both halves of the caller triple now come from the gate's own sources, the owner included, so a manager running under a user-shaped identity cannot re-open the mismatch in the owner half.

### Minor Changes

- 57d3a57: A Claude session publishes a structured event plane, and the `tr-<name>` transcript mirror is
  retired

  A session launched with `cotal spawn --events` now actually publishes. The Claude connector maps
  its session records to structured events behind the same hook relay the mirror used to sit behind:
  run boundaries per turn, assistant text, reasoning, and each tool call with its arguments, its end
  and its result, written to a per-session write-ahead log before they go on the wire so a restart
  resumes at its cursor instead of replaying or skipping. Until now no connector constructed the
  emitter at all, so every event channel was empty.

  The `tr-<name>` mirror is removed in the same change rather than deprecated alongside it. Gone with
  it: the `--transcript` and `--no-transcript` flags on `cotal spawn`, the `transcript` field on the
  manager's spawn op and its service contract, `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT` and `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT`,
  `LaunchOpts.transcript`, `Connector.transcriptChannel`, and the mirror in all three connectors that
  carried one.

  MIGRATION. If you read a `tr-<name>` channel, nothing publishes to it any more. A managed session no
  longer mirrors its prose there under any flag or environment variable, and a spawn that passes
  `--transcript` now fails on an unknown flag rather than being ignored. Read the session's event
  channel instead: launch with `--events` and subscribe to `events.<owner>.<actor>`, which is keyed on
  the session's principal. On a static mesh that is `events.local.<key>`, where the key is what the
  manager allocated and the spawn reply carries it as `id`; on a user-auth mesh it is
  `events.<your-owner>.<agent-name>`, where the actor half is the agent's own name. `connect-claude.md`
  gives both forms. `cotal console` and the web console render event frames directly. Unlike
  `tr-<name>`, you cannot simply subscribe: the plane needs an out-of-band grant, and the command for
  it is under "To let something read a plane" below.

  What you gain and what you lose, both stated. A tool call now arrives with its full arguments, its
  end and its result, in a vocabulary a program can read, where the mirror gave a truncated one-liner
  of glyph-prefixed text. What you lose is prompt text somebody else wrote: the mirror republished
  every prompt, and the event plane withholds the body of a turn the agent did not author, because
  republishing a peer's message onto a channel that peer may not read crosses an ACL boundary. A
  peer-authored turn still opens a run and still shows the work it caused. One stated limit on that,
  because the loss column is only useful if it is complete: a tool result is this session's own output
  and is republished, so peer text quoted inside one still reaches the wire. A cell in
  `agui-authorship.smoke.ts` holds that as a measured limit rather than leaving it to be discovered.

  A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is creating, and no other. A spawn that names
  a different agent's event channel in `allowSubscribe` or `allowPublish` is refused at the door,
  because that channel carries the session's tool inputs and outputs. The same rule runs on a manager
  resume: a retained inventory naming another agent's event channel is refused rather than adopted.

  The rule reads a **concrete** channel, two principal tokens and nothing else. A pattern such as
  `events.<owner>.>` is not an event channel to it and passes untouched, governed by ordinary ACL
  authority. That is deliberate, since the pattern is the form an operator writes on purpose for an
  observer.

  To let something read a plane, grant it out of band. The refusal prints one command, spelled out in
  full, for the mesh it is running on. On a user-auth mesh:
  `cotal actor grant <reader> --owner <owner> --scope '' --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --allow-publish
''`, every field named because `actor grant` is an upsert of the whole row and an omitted flag is the
  wide default (`>` read, `>` post, `spawn,role:default` scope), not "leave it alone". On a static mesh there is no
  actor ledger for `actor grant` to write to, so mint the reader instead:
  `cotal mint watcher --profile agent --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --provision`, the agent profile and
  not the observer one, since `mint` reads `--allow-subscribe` only for that profile and refuses it off
  that profile.

  `cotal mint` now REFUSES `--allow-subscribe` / `--allow-publish` off the agent profile rather than
  ignoring them. Those profiles carry a FIXED read set, the chat plane for observer and the whole
  messaging plane for admin, so
  `--profile observer --allow-subscribe <one channel>` used to exit 0, print a success line, and hand
  out a credential that reads every channel in the space: an operator asking to narrow got the
  opposite, silently. `--role` and `--provision` were already refused there for the same reason. The
  rows in `cli.md` and the sentence in `build-a-client.md` now say the same thing.

### Minor Changes

- 4cf5f72: Give a session's structured event plane a way to be turned on, and a channel that names who is publishing.

  An agent can now be launched with `cotal spawn --events`, foreground or detached, which publishes
  that session's structured event stream, what it did rather than the prose it wrote, on a channel of
  its own so an external observer or UI can read it. Off by default. Nothing about an existing launch
  changes.

  **The channel is named after the principal, never the display name.** It is `events.<owner>.<actor>`,
  derived from the principal the manager actually allocated. A display name is UI convenience: this
  mesh permits two live agents to carry one, and the manager itself auto-numbers a collision, so a
  name-keyed channel would fuse two principals onto one subject and, in auth mode, would authorize both
  onto it from a value that identifies neither. The derivation is a single function on the connector
  contract, `eventChannel`, so the subject the manager grants and the subject the session publishes to
  cannot drift apart. A connector that does not implement it refuses `--events` before any provisioning
  rather than starting a session whose events have nowhere legal to land, and the refusal releases the
  name it had already reserved.

  **The flag and the grant are deliberately separate.** Holding publish rights on a channel is not a
  request to publish to it. An agent file or a manifest can hand-write anything into `allowPublish`, so
  if a grant could arm the plane, any author who could write an agent file could turn on a full
  transcript of another seat's tool inputs and outputs without ever touching the launch grammar. Only
  the launch arms the session; the grant is what makes the arming useful. `cotal_spawn`, the peer-facing
  tool, does not expose the option at all. That is the shape of the tool and not a control-plane refusal:
  the manager's spawn service op is a second door onto the same handler and still accepts the field,
  which is a pre-existing property of that door and is fenced separately.

  **The flag rides the whole launch path, including the record a restart reads.** It is on the
  foreground launch, the detached spawn payload, the manager service contract, and the resume document,
  so a manager restart brings an armed session back armed. The foreground path mints its own grant, from
  the principal it allocated, and passes the workspace root the emitter's write-ahead log needs: a
  session armed by one launch surface and not the other would be a flag that means two different
  things. A resume adopts the credential the spawn wrote rather than minting a new
  one, so what a restart can lose is the record: either the channel leaves `allowPublish`, or the
  arming flag does and the session returns holding publish rights it will never use, which reads as a
  working system with an empty panel. Both halves are now carried and both are asserted.

  **One behaviour change to state plainly.** The foreground launch now passes the mesh's root as the
  launch's workspace root, on every foreground spawn rather than only on an armed one, which is what the
  manager has always done. Two connectors already read that field and root their per-agent home at it:
  Codex, which puts its per-agent home under it, and OpenCode, which puts its database and its serve
  pidfile there. Both previously fell back to the directory the operator happened to run the command
  in. So a foreground Codex or OpenCode session moves its local state from that directory to the mesh
  root, which is where its detached counterpart has always put it. Operators who ran `cotal spawn` from
  somewhere other than the mesh root will find that session's state under the mesh root instead. The
  Claude connector reads the field only on an armed launch, and Hermes and pi do not read it at all.

  **Supporting pieces in the shared connector runtime.** The event vocabulary is exported from
  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` for the first time, so a connector can reach it by package name instead of
  by deep path. The emitter gained a way to close an open run out of band: a harness reports the end of
  a turn through a lifecycle hook that writes no record, so a record-sourced stream previously had no
  vehicle for a turn terminal. The closing frame is an ordinary frame with one exception, it republishes
  the source cursor unchanged, because advancing it would mark records consumed that were never mapped
  and leave a consumer no gap to notice it by. The emitter refuses to close while a message or a tool
  call is still open under the run, while a frame is still pending recovery, and after a halt.

  **One pre-existing limit this makes visible earlier.** In user mode the allocated actor is the display
  name, and principal tokens forbid `-`, which is reserved as the principal name form's separator. The
  manager's collision handling appends `-2`, so the second user-mode launch of any persona has never
  been principal-keyable; it already failed at the identity and provisioning sites. The event grant is
  derived before provisioning, so that launch now fails before it leaves a footprint rather than after.
  The underlying naming limit is unchanged and is not addressed here.

- 9c2412c: `cotal input --name <seat> --text <text> [--no-enter]` types one line into a running managed agent's terminal and returns, so a program can deliver a harness command (`/compact`, `/clear`, `/model`) without holding an `attach` stream open. It is backed by a new manager op `input`, which carries the same row shape and the same authorization as `attach` (capability `manager.lifecycle`, targeted, authz modes `owner` and `any`), takes `{text, enter?}` with the text verbatim up to 64KiB, and answers `{name, bytes}`. Enter is appended unless suppressed; nothing is echoed back. The manager's cluster document is revision 7, so a caller's `describe` sees the new command. `AgentHandle` gains an optional `write(data)`: the `pty` runtime implements it, and the external terminal runtimes (`tmux`, `cmux`, `orca`, `herdr`) do not own the child's input stream, so `input` refuses and names the runtime rather than dropping the keystroke. The command is granted only to operator credentials, in both modes, and NOT to the `spawn` capability that already carries `despawn` and `attach`. That placement is deliberate: an `attach` grant needs a `session-caller` credential to redeem and an agent profile cannot mint one, so `input` would be genuinely new authority rather than a restatement of `attach`, and the own-owner rule that bounds `despawn` covers every seat under an owner rather than only the ones a caller launched. Killing a peer is denial; typing into a peer is control of it. On a user-auth mesh `cotal input` therefore needs ledger scope `admin`, the scope `ps` already needs there.

### Patch Changes

- 2752fe7: Stop `cotal ps` waiting on registrations whose host is gone, and give those registrations an exit.

  A class scatter's gather has two exits: every frozen slot answered, or the deadline. The expected set
  is frozen from the service registry, which records registration rather than liveness, and an instance
  that crashes never deregisters, so its record goes on claiming a live instance for as long as the
  bucket exists. That leaves a slot which can never answer, which makes the first exit unreachable, so
  the deadline is paid in full on every scatter in the space, indefinitely. Measured on the laptop this
  was built against: `cotal ps` at 12.5s with one true corpse in the set, ending in a row that read
  `unreachable` for a machine that had been gone for weeks. There was no way to remove that record.
  Three things were wrong, one per layer, and all three are fixed here.

  **The scatter can now be told an instance is gone.** `epScatter` takes an optional `probeLiveness`
  hook and ends the gather once every frozen slot has either produced a valid reply or been affirmed
  gone. It moves the classification point and nothing else: an affirmed-gone slot is still `missing`,
  still surfaced, still not `complete`, and a straggler arriving after an early finish is still reported
  `late` rather than dropped. Only the verdict `gone` licenses anything; `live`, `unknown`, a hook that
  throws, and any value outside the closed set all leave the full deadline standing, so a broken probe
  degrades to exactly the previous behaviour rather than to a fast wrong answer. `epProbeInstanceInterest`
  supplies that verdict from the broker itself: a `describe` cast on the instance's own rail with the
  reserved no-responders sentinel as its reply-to, the same primitive and trust rule `epCall` already
  relies on. A serving incarnation subscribes its instance rail for every command it serves and every
  endpoint must serve `describe`, so silence on that rail is evidence of absence rather than absence of
  evidence. The reply is never read, so an instance whose describe is broken still reads as present.

  **And a probe is never a reason to still be running.** Against a live instance the probe is never
  answered, because the request is a cast and a responder must not reply to one, so its deadline timer
  runs the full budget on every healthy instance every time. Wired into `cotal ps` that was measured at
  four extra seconds after the last row was printed, on a mesh with no dead registration in it at all:
  12.8s with the probe against 8.8s with it switched off, same tree and same mesh. The timer is now
  unref'd, so a probe still settles `unknown` at its budget for anyone waiting on it and no longer holds
  the event loop open for a caller whose gather has already finished. The same measurement after the fix
  is 8.6s to 9.4s.

  **The probe belongs to the caller, not to the scatter.** Asking about an instance is a publish on that
  instance's rail, and a credential holding no row for it is refused by the broker asynchronously while
  the publish returns normally, so a refused probe is silent and silence is what a live but slow instance
  looks like. Core cannot tell those apart because core does not know what the credential carries. So
  `epScatterService` forwards a caller-supplied hook and never invents one, and the CLI supplies a closure
  that returns `unknown` without publishing for any id outside its pinned set, and reports a refusal the
  broker raises anyway instead of letting it expire into a timeout. That refusal is attributed to the
  instance its own subject names, parsed as an exact route token, so one refusal is never charged to a
  second frozen instance whose id happens to be a prefix of the refused one. `cotal ps` freezes the class on its
  first connection, re-mints an instrument pinned to exactly the frozen ids, and resolves and scatters on
  a second. `instancePinnedInstrumentCapabilities` accepts several ids as well as one; each still emits
  its own concrete rows, so no wildcard instance is minted and the existing boundary on instance
  addressing is unchanged.

  **A registration now has an exit, in two explicit routes.** A manager that stops cleanly deletes its own
  `svc` spec and status keys, so an instance that was shut down leaves no row behind; a manager that loses
  its lease still tears down fail-closed and deliberately does not deregister, because at that point it is
  not the authority on its own record. For the host that cannot cooperate, `cotal deregister-instance
--instance <id>` removes the record, on the same evidence the scatter acts on and no weaker: it asks the
  instance first and refuses if it answers, refuses if the probe could not run at all, refuses if the
  instance is merely quiet, and deletes both keys at the revisions it read only when the broker affirms
  that nothing is subscribed on that instance's own rail. Silence is never the evidence, because a wedged
  process still holds its subscriptions and an unanswered describe is what a dead host, a hung one and a
  slow one all look like. A dead process holds no subscription, so a real corpse still deletes. Nothing
  sweeps the registry on age or on silence. Registering over a deregistration tombstone now works on both
  keys, so a deregistered instance re-registers normally on its next start, with its epoch advancing.

  **Rows split by what was actually established.** A silent instance already printed as registered with
  no answer rather than as unreachable. Now that a probe exists, the four cases behind that one sentence
  are distinguished: a registration the broker affirms is gone says the registration is stale and prints
  the command that removes it, a probe that was refused and one that was never sent each say so, because
  both are facts about the command rather than about the instance, and asked-and-silent keeps the wording
  it has, since a slow host and a wedged one are the same observation.

  **And one layer down, the same shape.** The manager writes `.cotal/manager.pid` itself rather than
  having it written by whatever spawned it, so a supervisor started by a container entrypoint, by cron, or
  by hand is recorded like a detached `cotal up` is; the record is removed on a clean stop, and only while
  it still names that process. Every reader now verifies the recorded pid is alive and is a supervisor
  before trusting it, and a live pid that belongs to something else is reported as a stale record and
  never signalled.

  This does not help against an instance that is connected but not answering. A hung responder holds its
  subscriptions and is indistinguishable from a slow one, so it still costs the full deadline, which is
  the correct result, and the removal verb refuses it for the same reason rather than unregistering a
  process that is still running. A scatter with no probe wired behaves exactly as before.

- c038730: A manager lease renew that gets no answer no longer terminates the manager; the key is re-read
  first.

  `renewLease` treated every throw from the CAS renew as the lease being lost and fail-closed the
  whole instance: it cleared the renew timer, tore down every agent it managed, and exited. One of the
  things that throws there is a request that gets no answer within its deadline, and no answer proves
  nothing about the key. It does not prove the write failed, it does not prove the key expired, and it
  does not prove anyone else took it. The write may even have landed with only the acknowledgement
  lost, in which case the manager killed itself over a lease it had just successfully renewed, and
  took its agents with it.

  A failed renew is now a question rather than a verdict. The manager re-reads its own key, which
  separates "it is gone" from "I could not find out", and fails closed only on proof: the key is
  absent, or it is present and holds a different process. When the key is still its own the manager
  adopts whatever revision the broker actually has and keeps serving, saying so. When no answer is
  available at all the bound is time rather than attempts, because past one whole TTL without a renew
  that landed the key may have expired and been re-acquired, so the instance can no longer claim to
  hold it and stops on that ground, in those words.

  That window runs from the last write that actually restarted the key's TTL, and only such a write
  refills it. A re-read that finds the key present, still its own, and at the SAME revision is a real
  answer and the manager does keep serving on it, but it did not touch the key, so it cannot buy the
  holder more time. Reading a key is not refreshing it, and treating the two alike would let an
  instance whose writes are all being dropped serve on reads forever.

  Waiting is only safe if there is room to wait, so the renew budget gained slack. The TTL is
  unchanged and no stored config moves, but the holder now renews at a quarter of it rather than a
  half, and each attempt carries a deadline shorter than the period instead of the JetStream default,
  which was itself half the TTL. Under the old numbers exactly one attempt fitted inside the window
  and its own deadline consumed the remainder, so a single slow round trip was terminal by
  construction.

  Renews also no longer overlap. A renew whose reply is late runs past the next tick, since the
  re-read that follows it has a deadline of its own, and a second renew started there read the same
  cached revision and was refused over a sequence the first one had legitimately moved. That conflict
  was self-inflicted, and it reproduced on every attempt before the guard.

  Measured against a real manager process, with a relay between it and the broker holding back one
  direction for exactly one renew deadline: the request reaches the broker and takes effect, only the
  acknowledgement is delayed. On the old code the manager exited while its key was present, still its
  own, and carrying a revision newer than the one it was holding.

### Minor Changes

- 0ab9b4d: Move the auth plane's retirement rail off the retired `ctl` surface onto the endpoint subjects

  The auth plane served its generic "retire a lifecycle" operation on
  `ctl.auth-admin.<owner>.<actor>`, a rail the spec retires in full and states must
  not be handled. Rows written onto a deleted rail are defects rather than
  exceptions to it, so the rail moves to
  `ep.one.auth.retire-lifecycle.handle.<target triple>.<caller triple>.<nonce>`
  instead of the cut growing a carve-out.

  Two things get stronger on the way. The reply is now derived from the parsed
  request, so there is no argument through which a caller- or payload-supplied
  reply target could arrive; and the request and reply planes are disjoint, so the
  listener credential cannot express a request subject at all. The per-despawn
  requester credential now pins both its caller triple and exactly one target
  incarnation, so a leaked requester cannot be re-aimed at another lifecycle.

  Serve-time authorization additionally requires that the serve registration a
  request names belongs to the requesting principal. The previous two-token
  subject could not express the caller beyond a recyclable alias, so the rail
  accepted any registered instance's registration. This is alias-level binding:
  the registration is keyed by an id that is stable across restarts and carries no
  lifecycle uid, so a same-principal predecessor presenting the current epoch is
  still accepted.

  The spec rows also described an authorization mechanism the implementation had
  already replaced, and now describe what ships.

  This is a subject-plane migration, not a completed endpoint migration. The rail
  carries the endpoint subjects but still exchanges the pre-v0.4 request and reply
  bodies, registers no service record, serves no `describe`, and has no contract
  artifact — so a generic endpoint client can neither discover nor invoke the
  command. That gap is tracked separately, with the acceptance test being that a
  generic client can do both. The one acceptance-path hole is closed here rather
  than deferred: the request carries an id, the reply echoes it, and a reply that
  does not echo is refused, so a wrong-id success cannot clear a retirement hold.

  The requester's grant pins its target with the `handle` mode, which is normatively
  redemption-minted. This path is not: there is no issuer-signed artifact, no
  redemption step, and no lineage — the row is built directly from the minting
  manager's coordinates under root authority. It is used because it is the only
  target mode that can pin an exact incarnation, and the serve-time handler
  re-checks that triple against the current mapping. This is a documented
  deviation, not compliant handle semantics, and it is stated at the mint site and
  in the ownership matrix row. It resolves with the same tracked work as the
  envelope, since the mode and the envelope are one wire-conformance surface.

- 208ad1f: Add a guarded way out of an issuance gate left frozen by a crashed manager restart.

  When a manager restart is killed between deregistration and the successor's completion, the
  endpoint's issuance gate is left frozen under a registration operation whose holder no longer
  exists. Failing closed there is correct — it is what stops two incarnations serving at once — but
  until now nothing could lift it, so every subsequent restart failed the same way and the only exits
  were driving the internals by hand or discarding state.

  `cotal reconcile-gate` verifies the freeze-holder is gone, logs what it found, and then completes
  the dead operation exactly as the interrupted restart would have: revoke the credential family,
  verify-evict its holders, and reopen the gate at the unchanged coordinate with the generation
  advanced by one. It is a CLI command rather than a verb on the manager endpoint because the state
  it repairs is precisely "the manager cannot complete registration" — an endpoint-served repair
  would be unreachable exactly when it is needed.

  The affirmative check required a read half that did not exist. The only principal-scoped liveness
  was fused with the KICK inside `evictPrincipal`, so using it as a precheck would have killed a live
  holder before anything could refuse on its behalf. This adds a read-only `principalLiveness`
  delivery-admin verb (observer credential only, closed query, a reply bound to the exact principal
  asked about) reporting `live` / `gone` / `unknown` with scan completeness kept separate. Its sweep
  is the strict one the plane-liveness oracle already used — full reply validation plus the
  single-server proof — now extracted and shared by both, so a probe can never be laxer than the
  repair it authorizes.

  Every refusal names its condition (`holder-alive`, `holder-unknown`, `liveness-unestablishable`,
  `not-frozen`, `wrong-op-kind`, `no-gate`, `eviction-unverified`, `raced`). A timeout is
  unknowability rather than death, the probe is a precondition on top of the barrier's own verified
  eviction rather than a replacement for it, and there is no force flag and no path that discards
  gate state.

  Two defects in the shared `$SYS` scan surface were found while proving this and are fixed here,
  because the guarded command is only as good as the observation it stands on.

  A paginated CONNZ sweep could read a **lost later page as sweep-complete**. The first page comes
  back full with more promised, the next round is silent or answers with an empty page while its own
  total still says there is more, and the loop treated that as the end of the data. Since "complete
  sweep, principal not found" is the definition of verified-gone, a connection living on the page that
  was never delivered read as absent — so verified eviction could report gone for a principal that was
  alive. Both the read-only observation and the scan/kick/re-scan primitive had the same shape, which
  also meant the two of them were not the independent checks they looked like. A sweep now tracks
  which servers still owe it a page and fails closed when one stops delivering; a sweep that genuinely
  finishes across several pages still concludes gone, so nothing wedges.

  The delivery daemon's `$SYS` sweeps were **not bound to the account it serves**. All three
  delivery-admin executors resolved their scan account from the working directory at request time, and
  the detached daemon inherits its launcher's directory for life — so a daemon started from a tree
  that resolves a different mesh root would sweep a foreign account and answer a confident, wrong
  "gone". The root is now pinned once at start, and the account read from disk is cross-checked
  against the account the daemon's own credential authenticates as.

- b519e73: Add the Herdr integration: a new `@cotal-ai/herdr` extension with a self-registering `herdr` Runtime provider that spawns managed agents into panes of a dedicated named Herdr session (`cotal-<space>`), where the Herdr server owns them — so they survive the manager's terminal going away. Requires herdr >= 0.8.0, enforced by a version check rather than a bare binary probe, so an older herdr reports the runtime as unavailable instead of advertising it and then failing every spawn.

  Each agent gets its own workspace and name-labeled tab by default (`COTAL_HERDR_LAYOUT=split` folds them into one shared tab). A spawn is `workspace create` + `pane run "exec …"`, then a bounded wait on the real process table — `pane run` types into a shell, so a delivered keystroke is not proof that anything started. The `exec` is load-bearing: without it the pane's shell outlives the agent and no exit could be proven. Lifecycle is keyed by Herdr's stable `terminal_id` with the public pane id re-resolved per operation off the session-wide pane inventory; creds ride an owner-only launcher script, never herdr's command line or its native `--env` (which lands in pane scrollback); every CLI call is scoped with `--session`.

  Spawned agents do not appear in Herdr's Agents sidebar: 0.8.0 reserves that registry for recognized agent kinds attached to an existing pane, so an arbitrary launcher is never one. They are identified by tab label and a `cotal` metadata token on the pane.

  The CLI lists `herdr` among the official runtimes (`cotal runtimes`, `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/herdr`), and CI now installs herdr so the extension's smoke suite actually gates rather than silently skipping.

### Minor Changes

- 019afc3: The manager control surface gains three capabilities on the v0.4 endpoint rails: spawn as an action, multi-manager instance addressing, and attach as a mesh session.

  Spawn and launch are now actions (SPEC 13.6). Asking the manager for an agent no longer blocks the caller while the process comes up: the manager accepts a spawn goal and returns the allocated identity at once (`{name, owner, actor, uid, goalId, fingerprint, executor{lifecycleUid, epoch}}`), then progress events follow the launch to a terminal outcome. Presence within the readiness window settles the goal `succeeded`, an early exit `failed`, and the window elapsing with neither is `uncertain` (a bounded, durable outcome a later `ps` settles against the live roster, never a silent hang). A persona-derived name collision auto-numbers; a hard-pinned `--name` colliding with a live agent refuses at accept, before anything is minted. The `--detach` CLI spawn, the manifest `-f` launch, and the connector's `cotal_spawn` submit and follow to the terminal, so their behavior is unchanged. The goal terminal is fenced to the executing manager's own gate epoch (the terminal lands on an epoch-scoped result subject), so a superseded incarnation's terminal is invisible to current readers; a durable reconcile index lets a restarted manager settle any goal a predecessor accepted but never terminalized. The goal-fact writer is a dedicated, family-staged, renewed credential disjoint from the serve credential.

  One space can now run more than one manager. Each manager persists a stable logical instance id across restarts and advances its process epoch when it comes back, so peers address a specific manager regardless of which process currently serves it; a restart re-registers the same instance and evicts its predecessor's serve family through a scoped, one-registration eviction credential. `cotal spawn --on <instance>` pins one instance by its exact id, an untargeted spawn rides class anycast (the acceptance records which instance took it), and `cotal ps` / `status` become a class scatter that merges every registered instance's rows with per-instance attribution and labels a non-answering instance unreachable, never omitting it. The manager lease is demoted from a per-space singleton to per-instance liveness (loss stops only that instance's serving, never the space), reconcile touches only rows the instance owns, and the retirement rail authorizes on the registration gate rather than a name-derived holder, so a deposed predecessor cannot retire a target.

  `cotal attach` no longer returns a `127.0.0.1` websocket URL. It creates a one-use, holder-bound session over the mesh: the reply carries a signed session grant (no URL, never logged), redeemed once, after which terminal bytes stream on session subjects scoped to the two parties, with backpressure surfaced as an explicit drop notice. A late attach still repaints the full screen from a replayed terminal snapshot, and close, expiry, target despawn, and manager restart are distinct, surfaced end states. The browser console is now a real mesh session client over a served bundle (the broker gains a localhost-default websocket listener), holding only a per-session, rails-only credential that expires with the session. The manager's session writer is a scoped, family-staged, renewed credential over a dedicated sessions store.

- f85ffbf: The manager now registers itself as an ordinary v0.4 `service` endpoint (`manager`) on every static auth mesh and dual-serves its FULL typed command surface on the endpoint rails beside the existing control tiers — nothing removed yet. The served commands mirror every control op through the same handler cores: `status`, `ps`, `inspect` (per-agent read), `models`, `spawn` (the full 16-field launch surface), targeted owner-mode `despawn`/`attach`, the baseline self-mode `stop`, `define-persona`, `purge`, `launch`, the resume/preservation family, and the reserved `describe`. `ps`/`inspect`/`spawn` replies now also carry each agent's `lifecycleUid` (the coordinate a targeted request pins). Core gains the production endpoint-serve credential subsystem over the durable auth store: the §13.1 endpoint issuance gate and serve ledger (`epgate…`/`epcred…`), the registration barrier with fail-closed eviction, and the serve-mint release fence — plus a key-pinned one-shot `endpoint-serve-executor` credential profile scoped to exactly one endpoint instance's gate, serve-ledger family, and registration record keys. The manager drives its registration and every serve-credential mint and renewal through that scoped executor connection (never its standing supervisor connection), applies one shared lifecycle-membership + maintenance admission gate on both control doors (the legacy `ctl` tiers and the new endpoint rails), and renews its bounded serve credential on the standing renewal pass. Registration also publishes the manager's §13.7 contract artifacts — every command's schema root, its closure manifest, and the cluster document — to the per-space content-addressed contract store (created create-or-verify at manager start alongside the authority stores), and every agent credential's baseline now carries the store's read grant, so any caller can fetch, verify, and recompile the registered schema digests without out-of-band contract sharing.

  The control CONSUMERS now ride those rails (static-auth meshes): every CLI manager call (`spawn --detach`, `ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `models`, `down`/`up`'s resume and preservation phases) and every connector supervision tool (`cotal_spawn`/`cotal_despawn`/`cotal_persona`, self-stop, history purge) goes through the generic invoke path - describe, fetch the registered schemas from the contract store, recompile digest-verified validators, invoke - instead of hand-importing the manager's contracts; invoke currency is describe-bound (the answering incarnation's broker-authenticated identity), so a superseded or split-brain manager refuses instead of answering stale. New `cotal describe <endpoint>` and `cotal invoke <endpoint> <command>` expose the same generic surface to operators. Operator reach is now minted, not door-refined: `control-caller-privileged`/`control-caller-admin`/`deployer` instrument credentials carry tier-matched endpoint capability rows (the admin tier's cross-agent `despawn`/`attach` ride the operator-only `any` authorization mode, declared in the manager's revision-3 cluster document), the spawn capability additionally mints `define-persona` + `inspect`, and an `admin`-capability credential mirrors the full admin instrument set. Open meshes and user-mode bearers kept the legacy `ctl` path until the final slice below.

  User-mode meshes join the migration end to end: the manager registers its v0.4 service on per-user meshes too (the registration/serve machinery is operator infrastructure riding the space's static trust material), the CLI's bearer path derives its caller triple from the bearer's ledger lifecycle claim, the connector's endpoint identity is its triple in every auth mode (no ctl branch left in the connector), and `spawn -f`'s deploy probe drives `ps`/`launch` over the generic invoke path for both the static admin credential and the user-mode deployer view. Serve-side hardening: every `manager.admin`-class command (purge, launch, and the resume/preservation family) re-checks operator reach at serve time against the caller's CURRENT ledger scope on user meshes, so a revoked `admin` scope demotes the next call instead of riding out the bearer's remaining row lifetime.

  The migration is now complete: the manager's legacy `ctl` control rail is deleted. Core drops the `manager`/`self`/`admin` control tiers, the `ControlTier` type, and `controlSubject`; the server-side `ctl.delivery`/`ctl.delivery-admin`/`ctl.auth-admin` rails (the delivery daemon's and auth service's own carve-outs) are unchanged. Every credential profile is endpoint-only: agent baselines lose the `ctl.self` publish and control-reply subscribe rows, the supervisor serves no control tier, and the operator instruments carry endpoint capability rows only, so the old manager control subjects are unreachable end to end (publish rows, serve subscriptions, and handlers are all gone). The manager registers its `service` endpoint on EVERY mesh: auth meshes ride the scoped endpoint-serve executor; open meshes run the same gate/registration/serve-grant ceremony over bare one-shot connections (no credential is ever minted; the broker enforces nothing on an open mesh) and create-or-verify the authority stores at boot, so a raw broker no longer dies at the first gate write. The CLI's control layer replaces `ControlTier` with `ControlReach` (`owner`/`any`): the target's authorization mode derives from the resolved target owner (an own-domain target rides owner mode; a cross-owner target rides any mode, which the broker admits only for admin-instrument holders), open meshes ride a bare caller triple, and a raw `--creds` control caller without an endpoint caller identity refuses loud instead of falling back. `ps`/`inspect` rows pin `role` as optional (a manifest-launched agent declares none, and the reply schema previously failed the responder's own output).

- 9e13648: Static meshes now run the full §13.1 lifecycle for manager-spawned agents. Every static spawn reserves a never-reused lifecycle uid and activates a durable, principal-keyed registry head through the same shared activation saga user mode runs; a durable slot row maps the agent name to its incarnation (name reuse is serialized by the slot + the manager's hold, never by trust in the name). Despawn drives the full retirement barrier: the incarnation's ledgered credentials are revoked, its footprint is torn down inside the barrier, and the name frees only at the terminal. Manager-spawned static agent credentials are now bounded (24h TTL) and ledgered; the manager renews live agents' credentials ahead of expiry (a copied credential cannot renew and is refused at the manager's control surface once its lifecycle retires — the new live-membership gate authorizes control by the authenticated incarnation principal, never by name or credential tier alone). Crashed spawns and manager restarts reconcile from the durable registry, so no active orphan survives. `cotal up` now seeds the two authority stores on every auth mesh, and provisioning gains a key-pinned one-shot `lifecycle-executor` credential profile scoped to a single incarnation's registry keys. Unit A of the same slice makes agent secret files lifecycle-owned (`<name>.<uid>.creds`) with roster-aware name allocation, closing the despawn/respawn teardown race.
- 185e721: Renew the `$SYS` credentials without tearing the space down.

  `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are signed by
  the system-account seed, which is never persisted, so nothing re-signs them in place. The only
  repair the tooling named was "`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`", and that did nothing: `up`
  mints the pair only on the branch that _creates_ the trust record, so re-upping a provisioned space
  reused the same expired files and reported success. A long-running mesh therefore lost its
  membership feed and live connection eviction every 30 days with no supported way back.

  `cotal up --rotate-sys` is that way back. It issues a new system account under the same broker
  operator, mints both `$SYS` creds against it, and renders the broker config from the rotated record,
  so the broker it starts is the one that trusts them. The data account, the account signing key,
  every agent credential minted from it and the JetStream store are untouched; what dies is the
  retired system account, on every broker that loads the rotated config. It is refused wherever the
  on-disk material and the broker could end up on different generations: a running mesh; an open mesh,
  whether that comes from `--open` or from `broker.auth: false` in a manifest; `--restore`; an
  unfinished restore or resume attempt on the root, including one a bare `cotal up` would recover,
  since those paths can adopt a live listener and return without booting a broker; and a root hosting
  more than one space, because the system account lives in the shared broker record and the rotation is
  therefore broker-wide. `rotateSystemCreds` is exported from `@cotal-ai/workspace` and carries the
  multi-tenant guard itself rather than at the CLI flag. It is deliberately a workstation operation and
  takes no `SecretStore`: the `$SYS` pair has no store seam to be written through, and because a
  `SecretStore` cannot be enumerated, accepting one would mean a broker-wide guard that reads a local
  filesystem while enforcing nothing for the tenants actually at risk.

  A rotation requires every broker for the root to be stopped, and three checks now say so: this root's
  recorded mesh at the requested address, anything unidentified answering there (which refuses instead
  of relocating to a free port), and the root's own ownership records: a live or unreadable `nats.pid`,
  or any recorded mesh for this root still reachable. Without them a lost registry row, or a
  `nats-server` started by hand against this root's `server.conf`, was enough to bypass the running-mesh
  refusal: `up` found the port busy, picked a free one, rotated, and left the old broker serving the
  retired config while a second one ran against the same JetStream store. These are Cotal's ownership
  records rather than a scan of the process table, and the docs say so: a hand-started broker on a
  different port writes none of them and is the named residual.

  Two consequences the tooling now states rather than leaving to be discovered. The retirement is
  config-load-bound, so a stale broker still running the previous config keeps honouring the old creds
  until it is stopped. And a full backup binds to the trust chain it was taken against, which includes
  the operator JWT and the system account, so every full artifact taken before a rotation refuses to
  restore afterwards: the rotation says so as it happens, and `cotal up --restore` names the drift when
  the data account still matches. The commit is a trust-record write plus two credential writes, so an
  interrupted rotation leaves the record ahead of the creds; that split is detected rather than
  silent. One shared check compares each `$SYS` cred's issuer against the persisted record, and it
  runs on every auth-mesh boot as well as in `cotal doctor auth`, so the state cannot pass unremarked
  by a mesh that simply never runs the doctor. The boot REFUSES rather than warning: a warning becomes an unread log line
  under `--detach`'s success output, and live connection eviction rides the same credential pair, so
  booting would silently downgrade revocation to deny-new for the life of the mesh. The delivery daemon, which never
  loads the signer and so cannot read the record, compares the two creds against each other instead.

  The recovery is covered end-to-end as well as in unit form: a suite drives the packaged binary
  against a real broker, a real delivery daemon and a real manager, on a root whose `$SYS` pair is
  already past its horizon. It asserts the reported symptom (the daemon's membership feed does not
  start, and says which credential and which repair), that `down` + a plain `up` leaves both files
  byte-identical and the doctor red, and that `down` + `up --rotate-sys` clears it in the daemon that
  reported it. The survival claim is checked rather than asserted: an agent credential minted before
  the rotation still connects afterwards, the CHAT stream returns at the same sequence and count, and
  registry state written before the rotation reads back through the CLI after it.

  Diagnosis now names the cause instead of the symptom. An expired observer cred used to surface as a
  bare "Authorization Violation" in the delivery log and, one layer up, as a `membership-rw` adoption
  refused with "membership feed is not running", neither of which mentions a credential. The daemon
  checks the observer's own expiry before connecting and reports it, carries that reason into the
  adoption reply, and the manager warns on every renewal pass from the 75% point onward rather than
  letting the mesh discover the expiry at the horizon. `cotal doctor auth`, `evictPrincipal`,
  `planeConnLiveness` and the two mint errors now print the repair that works. Where the feed is down
  because its bundle is incomplete rather than expired, the daemon now names the missing files and
  distinguishes the two cases: a missing `$SYS` observer is re-minted by a rotation, while a space
  predating broker-sourced membership is missing the rw cred and the account id as well, which a
  rotation does not write, so it is told the truth rather than sent through a stop/start that cannot
  help it.

### Patch Changes

- 463d597: Derive the right to settle a goal from winning its claim, instead of tracking it with a flag.

  `serveSpawnGoal` used one boolean, `terminalEntered`, to answer two different questions: has this
  goal already been settled, and may this attempt settle it. The second is an authority question and
  the flag defaults to the permissive value, so every way of leaving the accept path was opted **into**
  committing a terminal unless someone remembered to claim it by hand. That is how a duplicate-goal
  loser came to commit `failed` on the winner's goal (#357), and the fix for it had to add two more
  hand-placed claims, which is the same shape again.

  An attempt now earns `ownsGoal` by winning the create-only `bindGoal` CAS, and the single commit path
  refuses anything else. Both loser branches drop their hand-placed claims: a losing attempt cannot
  commit down any unwind path, including ones added later that never considered this.

  `terminalEntered` keeps its own job, which is stopping a second settle behind a despawn that owns the
  outcome.

  This also closes a coverage gap rather than arguing it away. The sibling-instance branch (a foreign
  manager already recorded the goal) previously needed its own guard, and mutation-testing that guard
  killed no check because the duplicate-goal test races a single manager. There is now one enforced
  check covering both branches, and removing it reddens that test: 33 passed / 2 failed, the same two
  cells, as predicted before running.

  The sibling route is also driven directly now, by a new suite `smoke:goal-sibling-race`: two managers
  in one space, one request frame delivered to both, with A's goal deliberately left in flight so a
  stolen terminal has something to destroy. Removing the fence makes B commit `failed` on A's goal,
  and the recorded committer is B's instance id while the message names A's, which is what makes the
  attribution unambiguous.

- 9093440: A duplicate-goal loser no longer steals the winner's terminal.

  When two same-goalId attempts race, the loser of the create-only `bindGoal` CAS serves the winner's
  acceptance and unwinds. That unwind reached the post-accept fallback with `terminalEntered` still
  false, so the loser committed a `failed` terminal carrying its own abort message as the outcome.

  The loser fails in one CAS round trip while the winner is still minting credentials, spawning a
  process and waiting for readiness, so the loser's failure normally lands first. First-terminal-fact
  wins, so it becomes durable and the winner's real `succeeded` loses the CAS. The caller reads a
  failed goal for an agent that started fine. Two side effects rode along: the loser cleared the
  reconcile index entry that would otherwise let a successor settle the goal honestly, and dropped the
  winner's cancel path.

  The losing attempt now claims the terminal without committing one, the same thing
  `onTerminalDeferred` does for a despawn that owns the outcome. It provisioned nothing, so it settles
  nothing.

  Reproduced before the fix, on a real broker with a real manager and a real agent process, by
  capturing a spawn request off the wire and replaying the identical frame. The committed terminal was
  `failed` with the loser's abort text. Covered by a new `M8` case in `smoke:manager-spawn-action`,
  which carries a positive control asserting the duplicate actually reached the wire, since a replay
  that silently never fires would make the whole case vacuously green.

  The same claim is applied to the sibling-instance branch (a foreign instance already recorded the
  goal index). That line is reasoned by symmetry and is **not** covered: mutation-testing it kills no
  check, because the new case races one incarnation. A multi-instance race test would be needed to
  prove it.

### Patch Changes

- c88ef4c: `cotal spawn -f` now deploys to a remote manager: when the mesh's serving manager lives in another checkout or on another host, the resolved launch spec rides the `launch` control op inline — the manager validates it with the same untrusted-input contract as the file path and persists it under its own `.cotal/run/` (stale-restart and retained resume read one source either way). The ledger stays with the deploying checkout, so `down -f` works from there too. Also fixes a pre-existing re-apply edge: the transient persona file is now written atomic-replace instead of exclusive-create, so re-launching an agent after a partial deploy failure no longer dies on EEXIST.

## 0.14.7

### Patch Changes

- 12ad5e3: Close two attach defects: a capability issued for the wrong agent, and remote attach silently dying after a manager repair.

  **An attach capability could be issued for an incarnation nobody authorized.** `opAttach` resolved the
  agent name, awaited authorization — which on a user mesh performs a ledger read, a real async
  boundary — and then asked for a ticket by NAME. Ticket issuance re-resolved that name and bound
  whichever agent held the slot at that moment. A stop and same-name respawn landing inside the await
  therefore authorized one incarnation and handed out a valid terminal capability for its successor,
  which on a user-auth mesh can belong to a different owner. `url()` now requires the authorized handle
  and refuses when the slot has moved under it, and `opAttach` re-asserts the incarnation immediately
  after the await so the non-pty path shares the invariant. This is the same class as the name-binding
  fix in 0.14.4, one step earlier in the sequence: that closed the window at redemption, this closes it
  at issuance.

  **A manager replacement quietly demoted attach to loopback.** The bind host for the manager's
  attach/console face was passed only on the first `cotal up` and never recorded, so every later launch
  for the same mesh fell back to loopback: a same-root repair, adopting a preserved or restored
  listener, and a `spawn -f` manifest deploy. The broker, the agents, and the mesh all stayed up, so the
  only symptom was `cotal attach` failing to connect from another machine. It is not derivable after
  the fact — a broker dial address is deliberately not treated as a manager bind address — so the
  decision is now recorded on the mesh entry and read back by every manager launch. An explicit
  `--host` still wins, and a mesh that never asked for exposure records nothing and stays loopback-only.

  Also narrows `.cotal/manager.log` to 0600 (new and existing), since the manager's console URL is
  written there and that URL carries a credential reaching every agent's terminal.

## 0.14.5

### Patch Changes

- 1a1c4e1: Bind an attach capability to the agent incarnation, not the reusable name.

  0.14.4 made attach capabilities single-use, short-lived tickets bound to the one agent name the
  manager had just authorized. A name, however, is a reusable slot rather than an identity: if the
  authorized agent exits and a same-name successor takes that slot within the ticket's two-minute
  lifetime, the untouched URL would attach the successor's terminal. On a per-user-auth mesh that
  successor can belong to a different owner, which turns it into a cross-owner terminal handover, the
  same class of boundary failure the ticket was introduced to close.

  A ticket is now bound to the agent _handle_ it was issued against. The manager creates a new handle
  per spawn, so a successor can never compare equal to its predecessor, and redemption re-resolves the
  name and requires the same incarnation. Issuing a capability for an agent that is not running is now
  a loud error rather than a ticket that quietly never redeems.

  Covered by two added checks in `smoke:attach-auth` (40 total): a ticket is refused once a same-name
  successor occupies the slot, and `url()` refuses to issue for an unknown agent.

## 0.14.4

### Patch Changes

- eccf48c: Make `cotal attach` reach a manager on another machine, and credential that endpoint properly.

  The manager's attach face bound a hardcoded `127.0.0.1` and advertised that same literal in the URL
  it handed back over the control plane, so a remote operator dialed their own loopback and got
  `ECONNREFUSED`. Attach only ever worked when the manager happened to be on the same box.

  **Where it binds is now an explicit decision.** The endpoint takes a bind address, still loopback by
  default, so a bare `cotal supervise` and an embedded `Manager` keep exactly the machine-local
  endpoint they have always had. `cotal up` passes the address it bound the broker to (via a new
  `supervise --console-host`), which is what makes a remote attach work. The broker's _dial_ address is
  deliberately not reused as the _bind_ address: a manager may supervise a broker on another host and
  cannot bind that address at all, and a failover list's first entry need not be the server actually
  selected. Where the manager can only name loopback — a wildcard bind — the client substitutes the
  broker address its own control connection reached, so `up --host 0.0.0.0` works too instead of
  silently handing back an unreachable URL.

  **The endpoint is now credentialed, in two tiers.** It carries terminal read and write for every
  managed agent, plus the managed roster and the live mesh feed, so once it can leave the machine
  "unauthenticated but loopback-only" stops being a safe position. A mesh caller receives a **ticket**
  bound to the one agent the manager just authorized, single-use and short-lived; this is what makes
  the existing per-agent owner/admin check real, since a manager-wide token would let a caller
  legitimately authorized for its own agent swap the path and take over another owner's terminal. The
  **console token** is the operator's own, reaches every agent because the console drives all of them,
  and is printed solely to the manager's own output. The roster, feed, and PTY stream answer `401`
  without a credential; the static console shell stays open, since it describes no agent.

  Credentials never ride a cookie: cookies are host-scoped rather than port-scoped, so one set here
  would be sent to every other HTTP service on the same host and would collide between two managers on
  one box. The console URL carries its token in the fragment, which a browser never sends to a server,
  and the console page is served `no-store` with `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

  Also fixes an IPv6 regression in the same area: `URL.hostname` returns an IPv6 literal bracketed
  (`[::1]`), which `listen()` treats as a DNS name and fails `ENOTFOUND`. Brackets are stripped for the
  bind and restored for the advertised URL. An address this host does not own now fails with the
  address named and the resolutions spelled out, rather than a bare errno from deep inside startup.

  Covered by a new `smoke:attach-auth` in the CI gate (38 checks), including the cross-agent path-swap
  that the first design allowed.

### Minor Changes

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

### Patch Changes

- 02b3243: feat(secret-store): move SpaceAuth (the signing authority) behind the SecretStore seam

  The space trust bundle (`.cotal/auth/auth.json`) is the last and highest-blast-radius durable secret kind. It now flows through the pluggable `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition injects its own KMS/Vault store and no signing seed lands on the hosted disk.

  - New `@cotal-ai/workspace` API: `getSpaceAuth(store, expectedSpace?)`, `putSpaceAuth(store, auth)`, `deleteSpaceAuth(store)`, and `SPACE_AUTH_KEY` (`auth/auth.json`), byte-for-byte the current local path under `workspaceSecretStore`. `getSpaceAuth` validates via the new `@cotal-ai/core` `validateSpaceAuthForRead`, which accepts both a full trust bundle (fully chain-validated) and a stripped signer projection (the `mint --signer`/container form — account keys validated structurally), and never echoes stored seeds/JWTs/space labels in errors. `putSpaceAuth` is the single `sys.signingSeed` strip site.
  - `remintDaemonCreds(root, expectedSpace, store?, { preflight? })` reads the signer through the same resolved store as the daemon cred; `expectedSpace` is required and validated against it. It never overwrites the last-good daemon cred with an unproven one: proof is a broker `preflight` (the manager's live probe, which gates every candidate when supplied) OR authority continuity (the candidate is signed by the same account key as the current broker-accepted cred — what the offline `doctor auth --fix` relies on). A same-label alternate account (full or stripped) is neither, so it is refused rather than clobbering the last-good.
  - The manager reads its signer from the injected `ManagerOptions.secretStore` (`getSpaceAuth(this.secrets, this.space)`); `up`, `mint`, `backup`, `restore`, `doctor`, `spawn`, and the delivery dev-mint helper go through the store. `loadSpaceAuth` remains the sync FS reader for name-only/presence callers and the static-auth single-machine mint composition.
  - `cotal clean all` deletes `auth/auth.json` through the store as its absolute-last step, so a partial-failure reset re-runs against the correct space.

  Closes "no signing seed at rest on a hosted disk"; the remaining hosted gap is signer isolation (the seed is still decrypted in-process at the manager's uid), not custody.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- c3afdaa: fix(renewal): prove the broker accepted a re-signed daemon credential before reporting it adopted

  `cotal doctor auth` could report a renewal "adopted" that the broker never accepted (a false green). The daemon's credential-reload path now proves acceptance on a disposable preflight connection before it adopts, and the record + `doctor` verdict only ever claim what was proven:

  - The delivery-admin `reloadCreds` reply narrows to `brokerAccepted` (identity/iat/exp actually accepted) plus a best-effort `residentSwap`, never an unwitnessed "adopted".
  - The passive 75% renewal timer and the explicit reload share one single-flight transaction and both preflight before installing a candidate, so a rejected credential in the store can never strand the live connection.
  - The whole daemon-side transaction is deadline-bounded (under the manager's request bound) with a late-commit fence, so a hung store fails loud instead of a silent "no responder".
  - `cotal doctor auth` now exits non-zero and says so when the last renewal was refused by the broker, instead of letting cred-file health alone stand as healthy.
  - The ephemeral generation fingerprint used to bind the expected generation is redacted at the persistence boundary, so it never lands in `.cotal/renewal.json` or logs.

- 2ed747d: feat(secret-store): migrate the membership feed's rw credential onto the store seam with proven standing renewal

  The broker-sourced graph feed's data-account (rw) credential now moves as a full read/write/delete kind through the `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition can renew it end-to-end (KMS/Vault) the way `delivery.creds` already does. Local `cotal up` is byte-for-byte unchanged (the default is the workstation FS store).

  - The feed's rw connection adopts credentials the way the endpoint does: an async source read outside the (synchronous) authenticator, a preflight-proven cache, a 75%-of-lifetime renewal timer, and a single-flight transaction bounded by an absolute deadline. Its authenticator now only ever presents the last **broker-proven** credential, so an incidental reconnect can no longer present an unproven or broker-refused generation and strand the feed.
  - The renewal owner (the manager) and the daemon now share one `SecretStore`: `Manager` takes an optional `secretStore` (defaulting to the workstation FS store) that feeds `remintDaemonCreds` and every per-agent secret kind, and `startMembership` reads the rw credential through the injected store. A hosted composition that hands the manager and the delivery daemon the same store renews both daemon kinds without a restart.
  - `cotal up` writes, and `cotal clean all` deletes, `membership-rw.creds` through the seam (never a raw filesystem write/remove), matching the `delivery.creds` discipline.
  - `credsRenewalDelayMs` (the 75% renew-early convention) is shared from `identity` so the endpoint and the feed compute it identically.

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

Local `cotal up` is unchanged (the workspace `.cotal`-rooted filesystem store lands byte-for-byte on the existing paths); a hosted composition injects its own backend via `runAuthService`/`runDelivery`. `AuthProvider` methods now take a caller-composed `store`, and the new required `deprovisionSecrets` plus `clean all`'s seam-first ordering make a full local reset safe against split authority.

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

### Patch Changes

- e3a53e3: Add a connector-agnostic model/variant selector: the `cotal models` command, a `--variant` flag on spawn, and the core `listModels` / `ModelCatalog` + `LaunchOpts.variant` contract. OpenCode discovers its models and variants from the installed CLI; Claude and Hermes reject variants (fail loud) and set `COTAL_MODEL` when a model is given.

### Minor Changes

- 6c40280: Release the 0.10 line with the onboarding and local-stack work since 0.9.1:

  - Rework the CLI around dispatcher-parsed commands, operator-installed extensions (`cotal ext`), and extension-packaged web/demo surfaces.
  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

### Patch Changes

- 14510c3: Manager detached-launch hardening (#159 Part B). A detached launch now reports
  `started` only when the agent actually joins the mesh (presence-based readiness);
  a dead-on-arrival launch surfaces as a failure with its tail output instead of a
  false success, and a launch that neither joins nor exits within the backstop is
  reported as uncertain rather than assumed up. On exit — despawn, crash, shutdown,
  or lease loss — the manager deprovisions the agent's minted broker footprint (its
  `dm_`/`dlv_` durables and ACL row) through a new target-pinned, least-privilege
  `deprovisioner` profile, so exited agents no longer leave durable litter behind.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- a10ed79: OpenCode connector: mirror each agent's session transcript to its per-agent `tr-<name>` channel, event-driven from the plugin's in-process bus events (`message.updated` / `message.part.updated` / `session.idle`) — parity with the Claude connector, with no per-turn session refetch. The `tr-<name>` channel convention is exposed through the `Connector` contract (`Connector.transcriptChannel`) so the manager can grant the agent's publish ACL without the channel literal living in `@cotal-ai/core`, and the manager forwards control-plane `capabilities` (`COTAL_CAPABILITIES`) so a manifest-spawned agent exposes the `cotal_spawn` / `cotal_persona` tools its creds already authorize. Adds an end-to-end smoke for the mirror (`smoke:opencode-transcript`).

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

### Minor Changes

- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.

  - @cotal-ai/core@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 58f2d41: Self-serve channel join + durable backstop (SPEC v0.3 delivery rebuild)

  Agents whose read ACL allows a channel now join/leave its **live** feed themselves over a native NATS core subscription — manager-free, broker-enforced by `sub.allow` (join = subscribe, leave = unsubscribe). A manager-hosted **Plane-3 durable backstop** (a privileged fan-out writer → a trusted reader that re-authorizes every entry against the current read ACL and membership interval → a per-member DELIVER durable the agent acks natively, SPEC §8) ensures a post still reaches a busy or offline agent on its next turn. Channel membership moves to a privileged cursored KV registry (`cotal_members_<space>`), and channels carry explicit `live`/`durable` delivery classes (default `durable`; a space with no manager is live-only).

  The legacy per-instance `chat_<id>` live-tail durable and the mediated filter-move are removed — one clean model with no coexistence code. This is a wire-protocol change (SPEC bumped to v0.3): new and old clients do not interoperate on channel delivery.

  - @cotal-ai/core@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 878f406: Control-plane security hardening, agent env isolation, and spawn ergonomics

  - **Three-tier control authz.** Control ops are split into self-service / privileged / admin
    tiers, default-deny, with op↔tier routing that fails closed. `spawn` is now a declared
    capability (`AgentDef.capabilities` → mint → credential grant); destructive / cross-agent ops
    (including `purge`) require the admin tier and are denied to ordinary spawn-capable agents.
  - **Loopback by default.** The control plane binds `127.0.0.1` by default; `--open` is an
    explicit, auth-independent choice and no longer binds `0.0.0.0`.
  - **Spawned-agent environment isolation.** Runtimes pass only the declared env allow-list, never
    `process.env`, with per-connector model-key forwarding — no secret bleed between agents
    (verified by the new `env-isolate` smoke).
  - **Fork-bomb / churn bounding.** A synchronous `MAX_AGENTS` reserved-set ceiling, a
    minimum-lifetime cooling floor, and recursive child reaping bound runaway spawning.
  - **`attach` scoping.** Terminal read/write is gated to an operator's own children, or to the
    admin tier. The `control-auth` smoke asserts the credential boundary is enforced by
    nats-server.
  - Agent transcript mirroring is now opt-in (default off); `spawn` names auto-number on collision.

- 34c2cb7: fix(manager): clear all Claude startup gates in the pty runtime

  Claude ≥2.1.178 shows two back-to-back Enter-to-confirm gates on a fresh workspace (folder trust, then the dev-channels warning); the one-shot auto-confirm cleared only the first and hung managed agents at `starting…`. The pty runtime now presses Enter on a short timer during startup (matching the cmux runtime) instead of matching prompt text, so it clears the variable number of gates and the agent joins the mesh.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).
