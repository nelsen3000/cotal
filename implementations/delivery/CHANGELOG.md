# @cotal-ai/delivery

## 0.69.0

### Patch Changes

- cd45352: `docs/delivery-daemon.md` now describes the broker watch the delivery daemon runs. It no longer says a two-second authenticated broker probe is the active watch; after its start-up reachability check the daemon opens no other connection to check the broker. The page names the disconnect that starts the clock, the window (`COTAL_DELIVERY_BROKER_GONE_MS`, 15 seconds by default) that credits time the daemon itself was stalled, the absolute backstop (`COTAL_DELIVERY_BROKER_GONE_BACKSTOP_MS`, four times the window by default), the exit line each one logs, and how an expired credential is handled. No behavior changes.

## 0.60.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ca4d8e: Add the platform control authority: a closed `platform-control` view, beside the unchanged human `manager-service` view, that lets a host platform run one pooled control manager per assigned account without a human session (SPEC §13.1, §13.6, §13.9). `startAuthService` takes an optional `platformControl: { observeAssignment }` input, and the returned handle then carries `platformControlAuthority`, a typed in-process door served on no listener. It issues the existing manager-service request family under a host-derived `p_` platform owner (`platformControlOwner`), reads the backend's assignment fresh on every call, reuses the registration proof, process epoch and all-duty renewal unchanged, confines maintenance to the assigned instance, and refuses `prepare` and `activate` while a named predecessor manager is still registered. It refuses IdP tokens, another account, a stale assignment, another owner's instance, unknown fields (a nested `session` field included) and the managed-agent kinds. `@cotal-ai/core` adds the `PlatformControlAuthorityRequest`, `PlatformControlInnerRequest`, `PlatformControlAuthorityResult` and `PlatformControlAssignment` types, the `p_` owner grammar, and an opt-in `allowPlatform` on the principal owner checks and on CONNZ attribution (`principalFromConnz`). Only the platform family's own boundaries opt in: the issuance gate row, the credential holder row, the eviction and liveness sweeps with the delivery daemon's executors, the manager goal-index scanner, the run driver caller, and, for the platform holder only, the retirement target, retained-validation target and admin caller parsers. The membership feed and the message drop guards still refuse a `p_` owner. Presence has no owner check, so a platform endpoint's roster card appears under its `p_` owner. `startAuthService` also forwards a trusted-host `standingRenewableTtlSeconds` to the authority plane. The human remote-supervision path is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- b669a73: `cotal deliver` takes `--root <dir>` to name the workspace root it serves instead of inheriting it from the working directory. Without the flag, a workstation daemon started from a directory with no `.cotal/` above it now refuses at start and names the directory it searched from. It used to read its credential and registry from that directory, dial the broker, and only then refuse on a missing `$SYS` observer. `@cotal-ai/workspace` adds `requireCotalRoot`, the same walk as `findCotalRoot` without the fallback to the start directory.
- 972a76d: The delivery daemon now writes `• delivery: received SIGTERM, exiting (space <space>, shard <n>)` (or `SIGINT`) to its log before it tears down on a signal. A stop from `cotal down`, a service stop or Ctrl-C used to leave the log ending on routine work, which looked the same as a silent death. Every other deliberate exit already logged its reason. A SIGKILL, including the kernel OOM killer, still leaves no line.
- 350c87b: The delivery daemon no longer exits when a credential adoption arrives while it is still starting. Its lease turns ready before the membership feed, the timer writer and the lease watch are up, so a manager's boot-time `reloadCreds` could land in that window and reconnect the daemon's connection under the lease watch it was still creating, which then timed out and stopped the daemon. Until start-up finishes, `reloadCreds` is now refused with nothing adopted, and the renewal owner records that refusal. The next renewal pass or the daemon's own 75% re-read adopts the re-signed credentials.
- 06f48f4: CLI output is plain text when stdout is not a terminal or `NO_COLOR` is set to a non-empty value. The shared color helpers used to wrap every string in ANSI escapes, so `cotal --help`, `cotal status`, `cotal meshes` and the red error lines on stderr carried escapes into pipes and log files. The manager's and the delivery daemon's own always-on copies are gone; `cotal supervise` and `cotal feedback-intake` now print through the same helpers. The guided `cotal setup` and `cotal meshes add` prompts follow the same rule, so `FORCE_COLOR` now reaches them too. `FORCE_COLOR` turns color back on even when output is piped, unless it is `0` or `false`, and it takes precedence over `NO_COLOR`, the order Node uses.
- fb1bc26: Let a credentialed peer ask which plane is broken, instead of guessing at its own credentials

  The subjects that answer "is the manager alive" are owner-only, so a peer holding perfectly valid
  credentials could not ask. When its join or its send failed, that peer could not tell a credential
  problem from a dead manager, an unbound delivery daemon, or a broker that was entirely healthy, so
  every failure presented as a credential failure, because that was the only hypothesis it was able to
  form. A reporter running a 30-agent deployment for a week recorded six independent surfaces that each
  reported success over a failure, including a `pgrep` that matched its own command line and therefore
  failed in both directions. In every case diagnosis cost hours rather than minutes, and in every case
  the missing piece was the same: nothing could be asked whether it was alive by anyone who did not own
  it.

  A read-only liveness surface now answers that question. A peer sends a presence probe on
  `live.<plane>.<owner>.<actor>` and learns whether the manager and the delivery daemon have bound
  responders for the space. It is shaped like the Synadia micro protocol's `$SRV.INFO`, a well-known,
  read-only, presence-only request/reply probe, but it rides a Cotal subject inside the space rather
  than the literal `$SRV` tree, which sits outside per-space account isolation and outside every grant
  builder and subject audit the system already enforces.

  Presence is the whole answer. The reply carries the plane, one responder verdict and an opaque
  per-bind responder token (below), and nothing else: no holder, no pid, no workspace root, no
  runtime, no roster, and no instance id, since the token is minted from nothing and names no
  instance. That is why the probe is a
  request rather than a lease read: the manager's lease row carries the operator's filesystem path and
  a process id, so the responder reduces it to a single enum and the row never crosses the wire. A peer
  gains no read of either lease bucket, cannot probe under another principal's identity, and cannot
  subscribe the responder's serve filter to answer for a plane it does not own.

  Unknown stays first class, reusing the classifier `cotal status` already grades by. Only the broker's
  own no-responders answer becomes "unbound"; a timeout, a permission refusal or an unreadable reply
  all become "unknown", because each is a failure to find out, and reporting a failure to find out as
  health is the defect this surface exists to remove. A responder that cannot determine its own state
  says so rather than guessing, and a reply is never counted as health merely for having arrived.

  The reply also names which responder answered it, as an opaque per-bind token and not an identity.
  Manager instances coexist per instance id, each responder answers only about itself, and the queue
  group hands one probe to one arbitrary member, so two instances holding opposite verdicts made
  identical probes alternate with nothing in the answer to say a second instance existed. With the
  token a caller that probes more than once can tell two responders apart from one responder that
  changed state. One probe still samples one responder and cannot report a split by itself.

  SPEC §6.1 defines the `live` subjects, the `LivenessAnswer` reply and its grading, and the
  message-flow docs page describes them.

  A remote manager can now answer the probe it already binds. It runs the same start path as a local
  supervisor, so it binds the manager plane's responder, and its credential carried neither the serve
  subscription nor the bounded reply row. The subscription was denied and a peer asking about the
  manager plane received the broker's own no-responders answer, which grades "unbound": a definite
  verdict about a plane that was in fact bound, produced by a gap in a credential. Both rows are now
  on that profile, pinned to the supervisor actor that does the serving.

  The responder's rejection notice for a reply target outside the sender's own subtree now travels on
  the endpoint's non-fatal warning channel. It was emitted on the `error` channel, and Node's
  `EventEmitter` rethrows an `error` emitted with no listener attached, so an embedder that had not
  attached one ended its process when a peer sent a probe naming such a target. The plane was then
  genuinely unbound and the next probe reported it as such, so the notice manufactured the state it
  described. The guard's behaviour is unchanged: the frame is dropped and the responder keeps serving.

- 438e9ed: Close the pid record publish window. A launcher that died between removing the old identity pin and publishing the new pidfile left the old pid with no pin, which teardown signalled with only a legacy warning, even when the removed pin had been refusing a reused pid. The publish now renames a bridge pin holding the old and the new record's lines before the pidfile commit, and teardown checks the pidfile's pid against its own line, so every crash point leaves the old or the new complete record. Publishes of one pidfile are serialized by a lock, so a launcher and the daemon it starts can no longer overwrite each other's bridge or settled pin. A publish that cannot read a start token for the new process gives it a `-` pin line, so a crash after the commit reads the legacy record it was publishing, never the new pid beside the old pin. Replacing a legacy record carries its line as `-`, so an interrupted replace leaves it legacy, never torn. Teardown and a daemon's exit cleanup remove a record under the same lock, and only while the pidfile still names the pid they stopped, so a stop that races a publish can no longer leave the new pidfile with no pin. `removeIdentityPin` is deprecated in favor of `removePidPair` and stays exported unchanged for one minor line.
- aa12a1a: Gate reconciliation no longer scales with credential family size. `cotal reconcile-gate`, manager boot self-heal and remote manager maintenance revoke the family's ledger rows 16 at a time, then verify-evict every distinct holder in one shared scan, KICK and verify sweep through the new `evictPrincipals` delivery-admin verb instead of one connection and one sweep per holder. The sweep keeps up to 16 KICK requests in flight, so a family whose holders are still connected no longer pays one broker round trip per connection. Holders a sweep verifies are still recorded durably when another holder is not verified, and an interrupted sweep records none.

### Patch Changes

- 4aa8cf1: Add native-transport delivery health detection with explicit credential-expiry classification and regression coverage before replacing the daemon's periodic authenticated probe.
- 59a7e64: Expose an account-scoped delivery service handle with explicit store identity and per-context close while retaining the CLI daemon runner. Close membership connections after disconnected drains so stopped contexts cannot reconnect when the broker returns. Keep health failures during asynchronous delivery startup local to that context and close resources returned after a failed start.
- 576f622: A process's pidfile and its identity pin now publish as one rename-based transition, so a crash between the two writes never leaves a torn pair (old pid beside a new pin, or a new pid beside an old one). A crash still leaves one of the legacy shapes teardown already handles.
- 59672dd: Register the remaining hosted-runtime smoke entrypoints in stable CI fragments and report native assertion counts through canonical completion markers. Refresh the explicit-TLS call-site census. Make the resume fixture retain its first successful held-slot observation or require durable completion with a new epoch, and exercise completion before the probe as a separate regression gate.

### Patch Changes

- 15b4664: Restore the handover scenario cell F of the delivery starvation suite is about. Since the daemon began acting on the lease-watch event rather than waiting for its renew tick, a running holder re-took a deleted row before the replacement had finished starting, so there was no loser and three cells passed by reading the holder's own lease. F now freezes the holder across the handover the way cell G already did. Two matching repairs alongside it: the four wordings a losing daemon uses are one constant, since the lease-watch exit says the key was read `as held by` someone where the cells matched only `is held by`; and the suite waits for `close` rather than `exit` before grading a transcript, because a losing daemon's last line is the one naming who took its shard.
- 42448fa: A DM send now reports the stored sequence and the recipient's status at send instead of a bare success, and `cotal deliver pending <name>` reads a recipient's held DMs from the broker.

### Patch Changes

- 065717c: `cotal deliver` now resolves the broker for `--space` through the mesh registry: a registered space is dialed at its recorded broker (with the record's TLS requirement), a mismatching `--server` or a record for another workspace root is refused before any dial, and an unreachable recorded broker is reported with its URL and the remedy that fits the record's origin. Spaces with no record keep the local-mesh default, and the hosted (injected-store) daemon still learns its target from argv alone.
- 3e95455: `cotal deliver` no longer reports a refused lease write as "a live lease already exists". A CAS
  conflict against a genuinely live lease still gets that message; a permission denial on the lease
  write now names the refused operation and subject and says to use a credential holding the
  `delivery` profile. Any other acquire failure is reported by shard and message, distinct from both.

### Patch Changes

- 2e7558d: `Part`'s data arm is `{ kind: "data"; data: unknown }` no longer: `data` is now the exported `JsonValue` (null, boolean, finite number, string, an array of JSON values, or a plain object of JSON values), and every publish path (`unicast`, `multicast`, `anycast`, `multicastExpecting`) refuses a non-JSON value at ANY depth at runtime with a named error that names the offending member's path (e.g. `data[2].at is not a JSON value`). Before, a value `JSON.stringify` silently rewrote could reach the wire: `undefined` became a keyless `{"kind":"data"}` row that history returned while Plane-3 durable delivery terminated it as malformed, and `NaN`, `Infinity`, `Date`s, sparse arrays, `Map`s, and `Buffer`s were rewritten to values a reader cannot distinguish from real ones; nested bigints and cycles threw from stringify instead of the named error. A `data` part carrying `null` or any other JSON value is unchanged. SPEC §5 states the rule. The delivery daemon's feedback intake keeps publishing its record as a data part with type declarations only (no runtime change). Refs #1404.
- fe81419: The delivery daemon now watches its own shard lease key with a KV watch and quiesces at the delivery latency of that row's update instead of waiting for its next renew tick, so a takeover no longer leaves two processes serving one shard for up to a full renew period. The delivery credential gains the read-axis consumer rows on the lease bucket that the watch's ordered consumer needs.

### Minor Changes

- 44cdcc2: Make the delivery daemon own its liveness record

  `delivery.<space>.pid` was written only by the CLI launcher, so a daemon started by any other route,
  a container entrypoint, systemd, or an operator running `cotal deliver --space <space>`, left
  whatever was on disk untouched and every reader believed it. On a reporting mesh the record named a
  pid that had been dead for four days while the daemon ran under a different one.

  That is not only an under-report. `cotal down` decides what to stop from the same record, and
  `mayBeRunning` is the guard that must fail closed so `cotal down nats` cannot take the broker away
  from a live dependant. A record naming a dead pid satisfies that guard: it supplies the
  proof-of-death the guard asks for, so a live delivery daemon reads as clear and the broker goes out
  from under it.

  The daemon now writes its own record and removes it, with the identity pin, when it exits. The write
  happens once the single-flight shard lease is held, and not before: a daemon that loses that lease
  refuses to bind and exits, so writing on entry would let a loser overwrite the live holder's record
  on its way out. It is written before the Plane-3 bind so an operator can still stop a daemon whose
  bind hangs; readiness is a separate fact the lease's own flag already carries.

  Readers no longer believe a pid merely because it is alive. The delivery record's liveness gains the
  `foreign` state the manager's already had, for the same reason: a record that outlived its daemon is
  eventually re-pointed at an unrelated process by pid reuse, and `kill(pid, 0)` alone reports that
  stranger as a healthy daemon forever. A live pid is trusted only once its command line has been read
  and names the daemon, and `cotal down` never signals a live process that is provably not one.
  Attribution only downgrades on proof, so a platform with no argv source, an unreadable process, or
  one that exits during the read all behave exactly as before.

- 840e641: Stop the delivery daemon from removing itself when the host is busy. The daemon is coupled to the broker and exits when the broker is gone, but it decided that from elapsed wall-clock time alone, and a clock cannot tell "the broker is gone" from "this process did not get scheduled". Under local CPU starvation the two are indistinguishable: the poll's interval does not fire, so the window ages with no probe having failed; and when a probe does run, a process that cannot get scheduled cannot complete a handshake, so a live server reads as a dead one. Plane-3 therefore went away exactly when load was highest, which is when messages queue up and operators are coordinating.

  The exit predicate now depends only on evidence the daemon actually gathered. It measures the gap between consecutive firings of its own timer and credits the excess back as local scheduler lag rather than counting it against the broker; it counts probes that ran to completion and refused within the time the server was actually given, instead of time that merely passed; it reads its own still-open connection to that broker as positive evidence WITHIN the hard backstop, since a fresh handshake that cannot complete to an address it is currently connected to says nothing about the server, but that socket is cached client state that can stay open for minutes after a broker dies silently, so it defers nothing once the bound is reached; and a probe that rejects is recorded as an unanswered question rather than swallowed. On a starvation diagnosis the daemon reports degraded, keeps serving, and clears the state when the broker answers again.

  Judging a probe needed two rules, because starvation reaches a probe in two shapes. The loud one is an answer so far past its own deadline that the deadline plainly was not enforced against the server, which is what the incident captured directly: a refusal at 2554ms against a 1000ms budget, with the broker answering immediately either side of it. The quiet one is the shape a busy host actually produces most of the time, and it is invisible to a clock: the process issues a connect, is taken off the CPU, and its deadline timer fires the instant it is scheduled again, so the elapsed time looks like an ordinary prompt timeout while the server was given a fraction of its second. Each probe therefore watches a short timer's own lateness for its duration and subtracts the time this process spent off the runqueue before the refusal is judged, because a refusal is only evidence about the server if the server had the time the deadline promised it.

  That subtraction is bounded so it cannot become a blanket excuse. A dead port answers in about a millisecond, so it never reaches its budget at all and stays a plain negative however starved the host is. The two readings differ only in whether the answer beat the budget, which is what keeps "this host is busy" from turning into "no refusal counts".

  The guarantees that made the exit worth having are unchanged. A genuinely dead broker still ends the daemon on the same window and just as fast, because a dead port refuses immediately and the daemon's own connection to it closes. The starvation credit is bounded by a hard backstop that is consulted first and cannot be deferred by any other signal, so the repair can never become a daemon that outlives its broker.

  A failed lease renewal is likewise a question rather than a verdict now. The daemon re-reads the key: another daemon's row means it exits, a missing row is repaired by an atomic create that arbitrates on its own terms, and its own row means it carries on. What it does NOT do is keep serving while it works that out. Whether the process should live and whether it may serve are separate questions with different answers, and conflating them would replace an availability bug with a worse one: a compare-and-swap keeps one lease row, not one server, so a daemon still consuming the fan-out durable and answering `ctl.delivery` across that arbitration can share both with the replacement that just won the shard. It therefore unbinds fan-out, the inbox reader and both control responders BEFORE asking, withdraws its readiness claim while it is quiet, and re-arms only on proof, its own row on a re-read, or a won create. A broker that cannot be asked leaves it alive and silent, because not being able to ask is not permission to keep acting. Those quiet periods are recoverable under the daemon's own power: the evidence that ends them is the same evidence that proves they were unnecessary.

  Two smaller defects were found while grading that path rather than by reading it. A re-acquired lease was never flipped back to ready, so a daemon that had recovered served correctly while every readiness waiter in the space timed out against a permanently not-ready row. And the ownership re-read reported the daemon's cached revision rather than the broker's, under a comment asserting the record carries none; it does, and a renew whose write landed with only its reply lost left that token permanently one behind, refusing every later compare-and-swap over a sequence the daemon had moved itself.

  A daemon could not prove its own lease row was its own. The ownership test compared the row against the bare connection key while the endpoint rewrites the card id to its principal dot-form and stamps THAT, so the "this row is mine" answer was unreachable: a daemon re-reading after a failed renew did not recognise its own record, exited naming itself as the thief, and since that path drops the revision the release freed nothing. Comparing principals instead is also wrong, and the suite caught it where reading did not: the daemon's cred is a file every restart re-reads, so a replacement presents the SAME principal as the process it replaced, and a displaced daemon would read its successor's row as its own, keep serving a shard it had lost, and release the live holder's row on the way out. A row is now proven ours by holder AND a per-run incarnation, so a successor's row is never adopted.

  An ordinary stop could strand the shard, with no starvation and no broker fault involved. The daemon creates its lease row early in start-up and used to register its signal handlers only after binding Plane-3, flipping the row ready, and awaiting the membership feed and timer writer. A stop signal in between took the default action: immediate death, no release, the row claiming the shard with no process behind it until the bucket TTL expired, after which the next `cotal up` was refused outright and the shard was unservable by anyone. This was previously masked by a readiness wait that did not name whose readiness it was waiting for; correcting that wait made `cotal up` return the instant the row appears, and exposed it. Handlers are now armed the statement after the shard becomes the daemon's, a start-up fault in the same window releases the shard while still reporting the error and a non-zero exit, and shutdown releases against the broker's revision rather than the token the process happened to be holding, which a readiness write is enough to leave one step behind.

  `smoke:delivery-broker-coupling` was carried as untriaged debt and was grading nothing. It spawned the daemon without a `$SYS` observer cred and from a working directory whose root walk climbed out of the repo, so the daemon refused during startup, and that refusal satisfied the suite's own "exits when the broker is gone" assertion. It is now provisioned, pinned to a scratch workspace, required to name the reason it exited rather than merely to exit, and gated in CI.

### Minor Changes

- b00f3c1: Refuse a two-root daemon-credential composition at construction. The manager challenges the delivery daemon's reload-store identity before the first remint, and the refusal names both stores. Fingerprint-only reloadCreds stays once both sides read one SecretStore. A store declares its authority identity, or an injected adapter names its coordinate in COTAL_SECRET_STORE on both processes.

### Minor Changes

- a87709c: Every cotal-lang effect now performs on the mesh: the durable-action group is built end to end and
  the not-yet-durable seam is gone.

  `spawn` submits a real manager goal and returns the allocated seat's handle, and meters the
  agent's `permits` (`turns`, `wallClock`; the turn that would exceed one is L4001, and a budget the
  host cannot meter is refused at spawn); `conclave` opens a scoped sub-team as durable membership
  rows; `ask` parks schema-checked pauses answered through `cotal run answer` and tells the agent
  over the turn relay, one relay per attempt carrying the schema, the attempt and the previous
  refusal, which every connector's intake renders with the answer command; `monitor` registers the
  handle on its journal entry and `wait(down)` reads a monitored incarnation's death off presence
  liveness, refusing an agent nobody monitored.
  `turn` rides a new pull-shaped manager relay: the manager serves `turn` (targeted, the
  despawn/input reach) plus `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` (self reach, manager contract revision
  10), holds the payload on the goal-index note, pins the goal to the seat's incarnation, and denies
  at a goal-bound deadline hold; the seat side (all connectors) pulls pending turns, surfaces them
  two-phase into host context, auto-yields `done` when the host turn ends, and yields `blocked` or
  `handoff` through the new `cotal_yield` tool; the run client renders context with pending notices,
  arms its own pause on the acceptance's deadline as the L4003 authority, watches presence as the
  L4002 authority (a death the manager marks on the deadline terminal reads the same way), and
  honors handoffs (L4005/L4004 validation, the `handoffFrom` goal chain); the manager shows a seat
  one turn at a time. The relay holds on an auth mesh: the agent baseline gains the self-mode
  `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` rows, the operator seat-write set (`control-caller-admin`, the
  `admin` capability) gains `turn` beside `input`, and the manager mints the deadline hold's
  schedule over its serve connection and owner-expires the hold once due instead of reading a
  fire it holds no grant for. `wait(replied)` observes the run's own turn terminals as a level, and never a
  turn the run itself ended without an accepted yield. A `spawn` may bind a logical worktree: the
  validator rejects two literal-worktree spawns in one concurrent scope (L3022, named branch
  functions included) and the runtime claims a tree before it submits, refusing a second spawn into
  a tree held by a live seat or by a spawn in flight (L4008), with sequential reuse the moment the
  holder's presence lapses. A spawn refused at accept is L4000 (L4001 for seat capacity) and one
  whose seat never came up is L4002; an `ask` whose deadline passes with no conforming record is
  L4006; a fork copies a spawn that said `onFork: "adopt"` and refuses one that would have to
  respawn (L5019). The run driver re-issues
  recorded-but-undischarged cancellations at adoption, so recovery does not wait for completion to
  release a dead loser's seat, pause, or tree. A migration's `--adopt <handle>` hands the orphaned
  seat to the edited program's next spawn of that persona, and `--release <handle>` despawns it at
  commit through the run's own discharge; both name the agent the step spawned, and a spawn that
  produced none is an orphan like a sleep; the adopting spawn binds the orphaned spawn's goal as
  its own, so a resume re-reads the seat and a cancellation despawns it. A turn accept the manager
  cannot finish unwinds to a failed terminal on its bound goal, and a retry of it is refused naming
  that terminal. The delivery daemon hosts the checkpoint timer writer, so mediated deadlines fire
  with no suite pump.

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.

### Patch Changes

- 31443f1: Make package-filtered test commands run counted assertions instead of succeeding without tests.
- 959b596: Validate workstation and injected scan credentials against the delivery daemon's account before endpoint construction or singleton lease admission.
- 7e45495: Make every shipped endpoint consumer explicitly surface or ignore recoverable warnings so retry and renewal failures no longer disappear silently.
- b323861: Prevent a wrong-root delivery daemon from acquiring and renewing the singleton lease before it validates that its scan credentials belong to the account it serves.

### Patch Changes

- 7c5995b: Key per-tenant material per space instead of per root. The five root-scoped kinds (the `$SYS` cred pair, `membership.json`, `membership-rw.creds`, `delivery.creds`) and every per-agent standing secret now live under `space.<hex>/` segments, migrated on first touch through one choke point that refuses — loudly, with an honest remedy — on any root it cannot show to hold a single tenant. `space rm`'s step-7 reaps land with their step-1 preconditions ahead of the verb itself. Also: the delivery daemon's `$SYS` repair advice now asks the guard instead of printing commands that refuse on the roots that need them, expired user bearers stop being re-presented on reconnect (with the retry bounded), and `agentSecretKeyForFile` takes the caller's space and checks the recorded path against it, so a stored path can no longer address another tenant's material.

### Minor Changes

- 208ad1f: Add a guarded way out of an issuance gate left frozen by a crashed manager restart.

  When a manager restart is killed between deregistration and the successor's completion, the
  endpoint's issuance gate is left frozen under a registration operation whose holder no longer
  exists. Failing closed there is correct — it is what stops two incarnations serving at once — but
  until now nothing could lift it, so every subsequent restart failed the same way and the only exits
  were driving the internals by hand or discarding state.

  `cotal reconcile-gate` verifies the freeze-holder is gone, logs what it found, and then completes
  the dead operation exactly as the interrupted restart would have: revoke the credential family,
  verify-evict its holders, and reopen the gate at the unchanged coordinate with the generation
  advanced by one. It is a CLI command rather than a verb on the manager endpoint because the state
  it repairs is precisely "the manager cannot complete registration" — an endpoint-served repair
  would be unreachable exactly when it is needed.

  The affirmative check required a read half that did not exist. The only principal-scoped liveness
  was fused with the KICK inside `evictPrincipal`, so using it as a precheck would have killed a live
  holder before anything could refuse on its behalf. This adds a read-only `principalLiveness`
  delivery-admin verb (observer credential only, closed query, a reply bound to the exact principal
  asked about) reporting `live` / `gone` / `unknown` with scan completeness kept separate. Its sweep
  is the strict one the plane-liveness oracle already used — full reply validation plus the
  single-server proof — now extracted and shared by both, so a probe can never be laxer than the
  repair it authorizes.

  Every refusal names its condition (`holder-alive`, `holder-unknown`, `liveness-unestablishable`,
  `not-frozen`, `wrong-op-kind`, `no-gate`, `eviction-unverified`, `raced`). A timeout is
  unknowability rather than death, the probe is a precondition on top of the barrier's own verified
  eviction rather than a replacement for it, and there is no force flag and no path that discards
  gate state.

  Two defects in the shared `$SYS` scan surface were found while proving this and are fixed here,
  because the guarded command is only as good as the observation it stands on.

  A paginated CONNZ sweep could read a **lost later page as sweep-complete**. The first page comes
  back full with more promised, the next round is silent or answers with an empty page while its own
  total still says there is more, and the loop treated that as the end of the data. Since "complete
  sweep, principal not found" is the definition of verified-gone, a connection living on the page that
  was never delivered read as absent — so verified eviction could report gone for a principal that was
  alive. Both the read-only observation and the scan/kick/re-scan primitive had the same shape, which
  also meant the two of them were not the independent checks they looked like. A sweep now tracks
  which servers still owe it a page and fails closed when one stops delivering; a sweep that genuinely
  finishes across several pages still concludes gone, so nothing wedges.

  The delivery daemon's `$SYS` sweeps were **not bound to the account it serves**. All three
  delivery-admin executors resolved their scan account from the working directory at request time, and
  the detached daemon inherits its launcher's directory for life — so a daemon started from a tree
  that resolves a different mesh root would sweep a foreign account and answer a confident, wrong
  "gone". The root is now pinned once at start, and the account read from disk is cross-checked
  against the account the daemon's own credential authenticates as.

### Minor Changes

- 185e721: Renew the `$SYS` credentials without tearing the space down.

  `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are signed by
  the system-account seed, which is never persisted, so nothing re-signs them in place. The only
  repair the tooling named was "`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`", and that did nothing: `up`
  mints the pair only on the branch that _creates_ the trust record, so re-upping a provisioned space
  reused the same expired files and reported success. A long-running mesh therefore lost its
  membership feed and live connection eviction every 30 days with no supported way back.

  `cotal up --rotate-sys` is that way back. It issues a new system account under the same broker
  operator, mints both `$SYS` creds against it, and renders the broker config from the rotated record,
  so the broker it starts is the one that trusts them. The data account, the account signing key,
  every agent credential minted from it and the JetStream store are untouched; what dies is the
  retired system account, on every broker that loads the rotated config. It is refused wherever the
  on-disk material and the broker could end up on different generations: a running mesh; an open mesh,
  whether that comes from `--open` or from `broker.auth: false` in a manifest; `--restore`; an
  unfinished restore or resume attempt on the root, including one a bare `cotal up` would recover,
  since those paths can adopt a live listener and return without booting a broker; and a root hosting
  more than one space, because the system account lives in the shared broker record and the rotation is
  therefore broker-wide. `rotateSystemCreds` is exported from `@cotal-ai/workspace` and carries the
  multi-tenant guard itself rather than at the CLI flag. It is deliberately a workstation operation and
  takes no `SecretStore`: the `$SYS` pair has no store seam to be written through, and because a
  `SecretStore` cannot be enumerated, accepting one would mean a broker-wide guard that reads a local
  filesystem while enforcing nothing for the tenants actually at risk.

  A rotation requires every broker for the root to be stopped, and three checks now say so: this root's
  recorded mesh at the requested address, anything unidentified answering there (which refuses instead
  of relocating to a free port), and the root's own ownership records: a live or unreadable `nats.pid`,
  or any recorded mesh for this root still reachable. Without them a lost registry row, or a
  `nats-server` started by hand against this root's `server.conf`, was enough to bypass the running-mesh
  refusal: `up` found the port busy, picked a free one, rotated, and left the old broker serving the
  retired config while a second one ran against the same JetStream store. These are Cotal's ownership
  records rather than a scan of the process table, and the docs say so: a hand-started broker on a
  different port writes none of them and is the named residual.

  Two consequences the tooling now states rather than leaving to be discovered. The retirement is
  config-load-bound, so a stale broker still running the previous config keeps honouring the old creds
  until it is stopped. And a full backup binds to the trust chain it was taken against, which includes
  the operator JWT and the system account, so every full artifact taken before a rotation refuses to
  restore afterwards: the rotation says so as it happens, and `cotal up --restore` names the drift when
  the data account still matches. The commit is a trust-record write plus two credential writes, so an
  interrupted rotation leaves the record ahead of the creds; that split is detected rather than
  silent. One shared check compares each `$SYS` cred's issuer against the persisted record, and it
  runs on every auth-mesh boot as well as in `cotal doctor auth`, so the state cannot pass unremarked
  by a mesh that simply never runs the doctor. The boot REFUSES rather than warning: a warning becomes an unread log line
  under `--detach`'s success output, and live connection eviction rides the same credential pair, so
  booting would silently downgrade revocation to deny-new for the life of the mesh. The delivery daemon, which never
  loads the signer and so cannot read the record, compares the two creds against each other instead.

  The recovery is covered end-to-end as well as in unit form: a suite drives the packaged binary
  against a real broker, a real delivery daemon and a real manager, on a root whose `$SYS` pair is
  already past its horizon. It asserts the reported symptom (the daemon's membership feed does not
  start, and says which credential and which repair), that `down` + a plain `up` leaves both files
  byte-identical and the doctor red, and that `down` + `up --rotate-sys` clears it in the daemon that
  reported it. The survival claim is checked rather than asserted: an agent credential minted before
  the rotation still connects afterwards, the CHAT stream returns at the same sequence and count, and
  registry state written before the rotation reads back through the CLI after it.

  Diagnosis now names the cause instead of the symptom. An expired observer cred used to surface as a
  bare "Authorization Violation" in the delivery log and, one layer up, as a `membership-rw` adoption
  refused with "membership feed is not running", neither of which mentions a credential. The daemon
  checks the observer's own expiry before connecting and reports it, carries that reason into the
  adoption reply, and the manager warns on every renewal pass from the 75% point onward rather than
  letting the mesh discover the expiry at the horizon. `cotal doctor auth`, `evictPrincipal`,
  `planeConnLiveness` and the two mint errors now print the repair that works. Where the feed is down
  because its bundle is incomplete rather than expired, the daemon now names the missing files and
  distinguishes the two cases: a missing `$SYS` observer is re-minted by a rotation, while a space
  predating broker-sourced membership is missing the rw cred and the account id as well, which a
  rotation does not write, so it is told the truth rather than sent through a stop/start that cannot
  help it.

### Minor Changes

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

### Patch Changes

- c3afdaa: fix(renewal): prove the broker accepted a re-signed daemon credential before reporting it adopted

  `cotal doctor auth` could report a renewal "adopted" that the broker never accepted (a false green). The daemon's credential-reload path now proves acceptance on a disposable preflight connection before it adopts, and the record + `doctor` verdict only ever claim what was proven:

  - The delivery-admin `reloadCreds` reply narrows to `brokerAccepted` (identity/iat/exp actually accepted) plus a best-effort `residentSwap`, never an unwitnessed "adopted".
  - The passive 75% renewal timer and the explicit reload share one single-flight transaction and both preflight before installing a candidate, so a rejected credential in the store can never strand the live connection.
  - The whole daemon-side transaction is deadline-bounded (under the manager's request bound) with a late-commit fence, so a hung store fails loud instead of a silent "no responder".
  - `cotal doctor auth` now exits non-zero and says so when the last renewal was refused by the broker, instead of letting cred-file health alone stand as healthy.
  - The ephemeral generation fingerprint used to bind the expected generation is redacted at the persistence boundary, so it never lands in `.cotal/renewal.json` or logs.

- 2ed747d: feat(secret-store): migrate the membership feed's rw credential onto the store seam with proven standing renewal

  The broker-sourced graph feed's data-account (rw) credential now moves as a full read/write/delete kind through the `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition can renew it end-to-end (KMS/Vault) the way `delivery.creds` already does. Local `cotal up` is byte-for-byte unchanged (the default is the workstation FS store).

  - The feed's rw connection adopts credentials the way the endpoint does: an async source read outside the (synchronous) authenticator, a preflight-proven cache, a 75%-of-lifetime renewal timer, and a single-flight transaction bounded by an absolute deadline. Its authenticator now only ever presents the last **broker-proven** credential, so an incidental reconnect can no longer present an unproven or broker-refused generation and strand the feed.
  - The renewal owner (the manager) and the daemon now share one `SecretStore`: `Manager` takes an optional `secretStore` (defaulting to the workstation FS store) that feeds `remintDaemonCreds` and every per-agent secret kind, and `startMembership` reads the rw credential through the injected store. A hosted composition that hands the manager and the delivery daemon the same store renews both daemon kinds without a restart.
  - `cotal up` writes, and `cotal clean all` deletes, `membership-rw.creds` through the seam (never a raw filesystem write/remove), matching the `delivery.creds` discipline.
  - `credsRenewalDelayMs` (the 75% renew-early convention) is shared from `identity` so the endpoint and the feed compute it identically.

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

Local `cotal up` is unchanged (the workspace `.cotal`-rooted filesystem store lands byte-for-byte on the existing paths); a hosted composition injects its own backend via `runAuthService`/`runDelivery`. `AuthProvider` methods now take a caller-composed `store`, and the new required `deprovisionSecrets` plus `clean all`'s seam-first ordering make a full local reset safe against split authority.

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.
