# @cotal-ai/connector-opencode

## 0.69.0

### Minor Changes

- 5dfd357: The OpenCode launcher keeps the server password off command lines and stdout. The 1.x TUI reads it from its environment instead of `attach --password`, and the headless `[cotal-serve]` line now carries only `port` and `session`. A headless host that drives the server passes its own `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to the launcher; without one, the launcher mints a password per launch as before.

## 0.68.0

### Minor Changes

- 585fdb2: Connectors launch on the model and variant their launcher resolved. `LaunchOpts.model` and `LaunchOpts.variant` are now the launcher's resolved values (the flag, else the agent file's `model:` / `variant:`), and every connector renders them as given instead of reading the agent file again in `buildLaunch`. Before, a model the launcher did not resolve was taken from a later read of a file that could have changed since, so the seat could run a model the launcher never checked or recorded, and a supervised restart re-read it each time. The in-session config takes the model and variant from `COTAL_MODEL` / `COTAL_VARIANT` only, so the card and the orientation pin no longer report a model the seat was not launched on. The Hermes connector no longer falls back to `HERMES_MODEL` from the spawning process, including one `spawn.env` forwards; set the model with `--model` or the persona's `model:`. Code that calls `buildLaunch` directly must pass `model` and `variant` itself.

### Patch Changes

- ad30240: An OpenCode 1.x seat whose instance the host disposes now ends instead of staying up off the mesh. OpenCode disposes an instance while its server keeps running, for example after a global config change or on `POST /instance/dispose`, and the next request loaded the plugin again from its process-wide cache. That handed back the stopped seat: the server kept running with the agent off the mesh, every `cotal_*` tool and native prompt was refused, and the manager still listed the seat as running. `dispose` now runs the same teardown as a stop and then exits the server, and the launcher closes the attached TUI when its server exits, killing a stopped or unresponsive one after 3 seconds, so the manager sees the seat end.

## 0.67.0

### Patch Changes

- 7f909a1: Remove sentences from the AG-UI holder and the Claude Code and OpenCode AG-UI mapper comments that described what earlier revisions of those comments got wrong. The comments now state only the current contract: the `boundPath` gate keeps start-once, the chain serializes hook events, the refusals live in `subject-frontier.ts` and `event-wal.ts`, the bracket interleave is open, OpenCode publishes `RUN_ERROR` through `AguiEmitterHolder.closeRun`, and the Claude Code mapper keeps its measured predicate counts. No behavior changes.

### Patch Changes

- 86ecb01: An OpenCode 1.x seat that has begun a cooperative stop now refuses a prompt typed into its TUI or posted to its server API. The refusal comes before OpenCode saves the prompt, so no model turn starts after the seat has announced it is leaving. OpenCode reports the reason, `the prompt was not run: this seat is shutting down`, as a `session.error` event for an asynchronous prompt and only in its server log for a synchronous one, which answers with a generic server error. Before, the stop fence returned early from `chat.message`, which OpenCode does not treat as a refusal, and the prompt ran a full turn while the seat was tearing down. A turn that was already running when the stop began is not cancelled.

## 0.59.0

### Patch Changes

- 608f5f4: Re-attach doc comments that had drifted away from the declarations they document. A `/** */` block followed directly by another one documented nothing, so editor hovers and the published type declarations showed no doc for the intended declaration (for example `Manager`, the `plane3` field and `AclResolver`). Each such block now sits above its declaration, is merged into the block it duplicated, or is removed when its declaration no longer exists. A new `pnpm check:doc-comments` check, run as part of `check:docsbundle`, refuses a doc block followed directly by another in shipped source.
- 5929b5b: A focus `@mention` wake on OpenCode 1.x is no longer lost when an ordinary inbox turn fails. The wake used to be handed to the turn driver and written back by hand at each exit that did not submit it, so a failed submission of a turn that carried no wake wrote an empty value over a wake that arrived while it was in flight, and the agent was never told it was mentioned. The `mention-wake` handler now records the wake in a pending slot, the driver only reads it, and only a submission that lands clears it, generation-checked so a wake that arrived meanwhile survives. Message bodies are still not buffered, so a channel with replay off still gives back nothing to recall.

## 0.58.0

## 0.57.0

### Patch Changes

- 93b98e9: Let a cooperative teardown publish departure after it has given up waiting on a presence write. Presence writes are serialized, so the departure publish queued behind the very write the teardown's intake bound had just abandoned: the wait ended, offline never published, the seat kept its last status until its presence TTL expired, and the plugin process never reached its exit. The agent gains `abandonPresenceWrites()`, which the teardown calls only on the path where it announces the bound expired; ordering behind writes that do settle inside the bound is unchanged (#2207).

## 0.56.1

### Patch Changes

- 6b76946: A seat resumed from a preservation cut backfills its channels from the chat stream sequence its prior incarnation had reached instead of replaying the whole retained window.
- baf7596: Fixed the OpenCode 2.x adapter dropping `cotal spawn --prompt`'s kickoff text: `plugin2.ts` now reads `COTAL_OPENCODE_PROMPT` and submits it as its first connector-driven turn, alongside the briefing and the persona as `system`, the same floor the 1.x plugin already runs. A failed first submission keeps the text for the next drive.

## 0.56.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a43218: OpenCode support adds a new supported host line, `@opencode/cli` 2.x, alongside the existing 1.x line. A single directory plugin target now bundles both lines from one entry file. On 2.x the connector adds a 2.x viewer and the model, session, turn, prompt and model.request routes over the plugin's own event stream, since 2.x carries no AG-UI event plane. An unsupported OpenCode version is refused loud at spawn instead of silently degrading. Two 2.x limits: the event plane needs `--no-events`, and `cotal models` is refused because the 2.x catalog is served by a running opencode server rather than the CLI.

### Patch Changes

- e0ed0f5: Re-arm a focus @mention wake when its turn fails after the submission landed, so the seat is retried instead of left never told to look again.

## 0.55.0

### Patch Changes

- a13c8bb: Capture the event plane's start boundary at adopt instead of at the emitter's first read, so a complete record written while the connector is still starting up (the mesh wait, log open, and preflight) is no longer silently dropped. Claude Code and OpenCode both wrap their session source with the shared `BoundStartSource`.
- 647dcf2: The session-reset mutation fixture registers the removal of the settle barrier between the old holder's chain and the new session's frames, so the ordering cell is proved to notice it.
- b58918f: The turn-wedge smoke grades the error-retry backoff under sustained failure: the doubling, one timer per window, the thirty-second ceiling, the reset after a completed turn, and a stop landing while a retry is pending.
- d284ee6: A manifest or spawn prompt on a connector that cannot deliver one is refused at preflight (including `up -f --dry-run`), at spawn and in the manager, the way an unsupported model variant is: connectors now declare `supportsPrompt`, and claude, opencode, codex, jcode and pi declare it; hermes keeps its launch-time throw as the second line of defence.

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 64d723e: Enable the AG-UI event plane by default for connectors that publish one. Operators and peer spawns
  can opt out explicitly, while connectors without an event plane refuse unless that opt-out is set.
- ec8649b: Preserve the closed required-events registration policy and enforce it across discovery, launch,
  grant coverage, direct connector sessions, and trusted upgrades of existing manual registrations.

### Patch Changes

- 4668927: The OpenCode connector's AG-UI emitter now waits for the mesh link before it starts. The shim creates
  the native session before the plugin's endpoint binds, the emitter started from that first event
  against an endpoint that had not started, and its holder failed terminally, so every armed OpenCode
  session published nothing for its whole life with one stderr line as the only record. The emitter
  now awaits the same bounded connection wait the Claude Code connector takes, and past its window it
  fails into the holder's terminal error rather than hanging the event handler.
- 37737cc: Refuse an explicit OpenCode model pin before joining the mesh when the running server's provider listing does not serve that model, even if the CLI catalog advertises it.

## 0.50.1

## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- b7e5942: A peer can no longer forge the framing of an auto-injected message

  The block that carries waiting peer messages into a turn interpolated the message body and the
  sender name raw, and the Hermes sidecar built the same shape by string concatenation. Both were
  forgeable the two ways the inbox reply used to be: a body carrying a newline produced a second item
  in the block, reading to the agent as a separate delivered message from a peer that never sent one,
  and a sender naming itself with a closing bracket ended the real attribution and opened a forged
  one. These frames are auto-injected rather than returned when the agent asks, so the agent never
  had a chance to distrust them.

  The rule both surfaces now hold is the one the inbox reply already held, and they hold it through
  the same code rather than a second convention: a line that begins at column zero is written by the
  connector, never by a peer. One message is one line plus indented continuations, with the
  attribution inside a single bracket pair. The neutralization moved into a shared module that the
  injected block and the inbox reply both render through, so the body, the sender name and role, and
  the service and channel labels all pass through one implementation. The Python sidecar carries a
  matching module, kept to the same character class on purpose, since a peer that can forge the frame
  on either side of the socket has the whole class back.

  Two widenings came out of stating the rule positionally rather than by example. The attribution
  class now neutralizes the opening bracket as well as the closing one, because stripping only the
  closing one still let a name render a bracket pair a reader takes as the innermost attribution. The
  injected block's per-item separator is the bracketed attribution the inbox reply uses, replacing the
  bullet, so the text of an injected block changed and the wake-path suites that assert on it were
  updated with it.

  A third injected surface holds the same rule now. A wake hint carries no message body and reads as
  one short sentence, so it does not look like a frame, but it is written into the agent's context
  without being asked for and it names a peer-controlled channel label, which three connectors
  interpolated raw. A label carrying a newline put a second line at column zero reading as another
  delivered message. That label renders through the shared module too, and the absent-channel fallback
  moved there with it, since three connectors each spelled it themselves and an absent field is what a
  per-call-site spelling is most likely to get wrong.

### Patch Changes

- 0a52594: Census the in-process half of the ambient-environment rule. `smoke:suite-ambient-env` grades the environment a suite hands a child; the new `smoke:suite-ambient-env-self` grades a suite that reads its own `process.env` through `configFromEnv` and friends, and requires a module-scope `COTAL_` prefix scrub before that first read. The connector suites in the class now scrub the whole prefix instead of dropping one variable, so running them from inside a connected session no longer dies in its own import on the one-identity-plane refusal.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.

### Minor Changes

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.

## 0.45.0

## 0.43.0

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- a87709c: Every cotal-lang effect now performs on the mesh: the durable-action group is built end to end and
  the not-yet-durable seam is gone.

  `spawn` submits a real manager goal and returns the allocated seat's handle, and meters the
  agent's `permits` (`turns`, `wallClock`; the turn that would exceed one is L4001, and a budget the
  host cannot meter is refused at spawn); `conclave` opens a scoped sub-team as durable membership
  rows; `ask` parks schema-checked pauses answered through `cotal run answer` and tells the agent
  over the turn relay, one relay per attempt carrying the schema, the attempt and the previous
  refusal, which every connector's intake renders with the answer command; `monitor` registers the
  handle on its journal entry and `wait(down)` reads a monitored incarnation's death off presence
  liveness, refusing an agent nobody monitored.
  `turn` rides a new pull-shaped manager relay: the manager serves `turn` (targeted, the
  despawn/input reach) plus `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` (self reach, manager contract revision
  10), holds the payload on the goal-index note, pins the goal to the seat's incarnation, and denies
  at a goal-bound deadline hold; the seat side (all connectors) pulls pending turns, surfaces them
  two-phase into host context, auto-yields `done` when the host turn ends, and yields `blocked` or
  `handoff` through the new `cotal_yield` tool; the run client renders context with pending notices,
  arms its own pause on the acceptance's deadline as the L4003 authority, watches presence as the
  L4002 authority (a death the manager marks on the deadline terminal reads the same way), and
  honors handoffs (L4005/L4004 validation, the `handoffFrom` goal chain); the manager shows a seat
  one turn at a time. The relay holds on an auth mesh: the agent baseline gains the self-mode
  `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` rows, the operator seat-write set (`control-caller-admin`, the
  `admin` capability) gains `turn` beside `input`, and the manager mints the deadline hold's
  schedule over its serve connection and owner-expires the hold once due instead of reading a
  fire it holds no grant for. `wait(replied)` observes the run's own turn terminals as a level, and never a
  turn the run itself ended without an accepted yield. A `spawn` may bind a logical worktree: the
  validator rejects two literal-worktree spawns in one concurrent scope (L3022, named branch
  functions included) and the runtime claims a tree before it submits, refusing a second spawn into
  a tree held by a live seat or by a spawn in flight (L4008), with sequential reuse the moment the
  holder's presence lapses. A spawn refused at accept is L4000 (L4001 for seat capacity) and one
  whose seat never came up is L4002; an `ask` whose deadline passes with no conforming record is
  L4006; a fork copies a spawn that said `onFork: "adopt"` and refuses one that would have to
  respawn (L5019). The run driver re-issues
  recorded-but-undischarged cancellations at adoption, so recovery does not wait for completion to
  release a dead loser's seat, pause, or tree. A migration's `--adopt <handle>` hands the orphaned
  seat to the edited program's next spawn of that persona, and `--release <handle>` despawns it at
  commit through the run's own discharge; both name the agent the step spawned, and a spawn that
  produced none is an orphan like a sleep; the adopting spawn binds the orphaned spawn's goal as
  its own, so a resume re-reads the seat and a cancellation despawns it. A turn accept the manager
  cannot finish unwinds to a failed terminal on its bound goal, and a retry of it is refused naming
  that terminal. The delivery daemon hosts the checkpoint timer writer, so mediated deadlines fire
  with no suite pump.

### Minor Changes

- 34ff272: `cotal run`, the workflow-run operator surface, self-registered by `@cotal-ai/runtime` and composed
  into the `cotal` binary: `start --file <program>` drives a new run on the mesh handler, `resume
<runId> --file <program>` takes an existing run over and drives it to quiescence, `ps` lists an
  endpoint's run records (state, holder, journal high-water, fork lineage), `journal <runId>` prints
  the durable step journal, and `answer <runId> <stepKey> --by <who> [--value <json>]` resolves an
  open checkpoint through the run driver, presenting as the arming holder read back from the
  checkpoint record (resume is holder-bound). One raw connection per invocation against the resolved
  mesh target; the journal's result bound is taken from the broker's own max_payload.

  `docs/workflows.md` gains an "Operating a run" section, the connector docs bundle carries it, and
  every connector folds a workflow steer (`WORKFLOW_STEER`) into its agent instructions beside the
  mesh-first steer, so agents reach for a durable journalled run instead of improvising long
  coordination loops in their own context.

- c4094cb: Drop inherited `COTAL_LAUNCH_MATERIAL` from suites that default `COTAL_SERVERS` then call `configFromEnv()` on `process.env`, so `pnpm test` no longer trips the one-identity-plane refusal inside a managed seat.

- 4ef59c3: A spawned seat now receives a constructed environment (PATH/HOME/locale, the machine-wide COTAL\_\* knobs, connector-declared provider keys) instead of the manager's ambient environment. Host-session markers such as CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION no longer leak into seats and silently disable transcript saving. The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

## 0.30.2

## 0.30.1

### Patch Changes

- 1814250: The published OpenCode plugin bundle exports exactly one symbol: the `cotal` plugin. OpenCode's loader treats every export of a plugin module as a plugin factory, so the log-marker constants `src/plugin.ts` exports for the smokes broke plugin loading when that file was bundled directly. The bundle now builds from a thin entry (`src/plugin.entry.ts`) that re-exports only `cotal`; the constants remain exported from the source module for the smokes.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 569f4d3: An empty message id is never a dedup key, and an id-less delivery is individually addressable at the drain seam.

  Two distinct messages that each carry an empty id collapsed to one: the receiver-side id
  dedup read empty-equals-empty as a duplicate, silently dropped the second, and once the
  first was handled it dropped every later empty-id message on arrival. Measured live, two
  such messages arrived on the wire and only the first was ever delivered.

  An empty id is now treated as no id: the ingest coalescing (pending, handled, protected)
  is skipped for it in both directions, so distinct messages that carry an empty id are all
  delivered. At the drain seam a per-delivery receive key (the wire id when there is one, a
  per-session secret-namespaced minted key when the id is empty, never on any wire) is what
  hosts, adapters, and the exact-key drain select by: cotal_inbox, the Claude Code hooks,
  the OpenCode plugin, the Codex host, the Hermes bridge and its Python sidecar, and the pi
  driver. The drain API is renamed for what it takes (drainInboxDeliveries, missingKeys).
  Eviction classification, in-flight holds, scope routing, the focus-recall tie-break, and
  the scoped drain's selection no longer key on the empty id either. The Hermes bridge no
  longer wedges on an empty-id message. Delivery pumps in core now treat an absent or
  non-string id as a malformed envelope per SPEC section 5 (durable terminate, live drop,
  history and recall skip).

  What this restores: before the receive key, an id-less delivery was unaddressable: the
  raw id swept every pending empty-id item in one drain call, and once filtering closed
  that, the item could never be drained or acked, was re-shown on every windowed inbox
  read, and on a durable channel accumulated as an unretirable entry until the 200-entry
  overflow valve evicted it, roughly a model turn of churn per entry, while one hostile
  empty-id ambient publish self-drove back-to-back host turns on the pi adapter. This was
  a violation of the SPEC section 8 ack-only-after-surfaced obligation at the receiver,
  not only an adapter defect.

  The cost is stated rather than hidden: with no id there is no coalescing either, so a
  redelivered copy of an empty-id message can surface twice on a path that is already
  at-least-once (live remains at-most-once). Dedup for real ids is unchanged: their
  receive key is their wire id and their coalescing is untouched. SPEC section 4, section
  7 item 5, section 8, and section 12 item 12 now state the receiver-scoped rule, and the
  client-builder guidance mirrors it.

  One named follow-up stays open: Plane-3 durable fan-out derives its publish msgID from
  the message id, so distinct empty-id messages can still be collapsed inside the broker's
  duplicate window on a durable channel before this receiver sees them. That path is its
  own issue; this change's guarantee is the receiver.

### Minor Changes

- a71fbd3: A failed turn is published as a run error, so a reader of an event plane can tell a turn that failed from a turn that finished.

  Every connector used to close a run with `RUN_FINISHED` whichever way the turn ended, including a
  turn its own harness had already classified as failed. `RUN_ERROR` was in the vocabulary, the
  bracket machine accepted it as a close and the dashboard rendered it, but the shared close path had
  no way to say it.

  The close on the shared emitter and holder now takes an optional failure, and two connectors supply
  one from a record they actually receive. Claude Code ends a failed turn on its own `StopFailure`
  hook, and that turn now closes with `RUN_ERROR` carrying the harness's error kind (`rate_limit`,
  `billing_error`, `server_error` and the rest) as the code. OpenCode reports a dead turn on
  `session.error`, and that turn now closes with `RUN_ERROR` carrying OpenCode's own error name and
  reason, except a turn a person stopped, which arrives on the same event and is not a failure.

  The shared close also bounds that failure detail. Upstream free text (`error_details`,
  `data.message`) can encode past the live frame ceiling; packing it as-is used to refuse the close
  before any terminal became durable and then permanently kill the holder. The close now rebuilds the
  one `RUN_ERROR` so it fits, keeps the code, and the emitted message says the original detail was
  omitted or shortened because of the bound. A short message is unchanged. There is no second protocol
  and no per-connector size table: every producer already goes through this close.

  Deliberately not built: connector-specific caps, a second close method, preview-plane truncation on
  the durable path, and any change to `packUnits`'s fail-loud rule for source observations. Those would
  not close this hole and would duplicate a contract that already has a caller.

  Migration: nothing is removed and no existing call changes shape. A consumer that only handles
  `RUN_FINISHED` now sees fewer of them on failing sessions; the event type it needs to also handle
  has been part of the vocabulary and accepted by the bracket machine all along.

- 7bc71ab: Serialize the top-level session swap. The plugin bus does not await the event handler, so a second
  top-level session created while the first swap is still draining captured the same holder to
  retire and installed its replacement over the first one. The dropped replacement had already been
  adopted, which is where its write-ahead log and subject frontier are opened, so it was orphaned
  with an open handle and the session it held left a run open on the wire with nothing reporting it.
  The holder they both replaced was drained twice.

  Swaps now run one at a time, so each reads a holder that is installed and no longer being retired
  underneath it, and the chain carries the absorbed tail of each swap, so the next one still runs
  after a failed drain.
  Installed rather than settled: a swap waits for the holder it RETIRES, not for the one it installs,
  whose adoption is still starting when the swap resolves.
  The connector also logs a retirement the way it already logs an adoption, which is what makes a
  retirement that never happened visible at all.

  Serializing the swap was not enough on its own, because the session id and the holder that serves
  it are two separate things and an event could arrive while they disagreed. Ordering them only moved
  the window: with the id assigned before the drain, an event in the gap was carried by the new id
  into a holder still bound to the previous session, and that holder refuses a second session
  permanently, so the event plane died rather than skipping a frame. Event work is now routed by
  asking the holder what it is bound to, so an event reaches a holder only when that holder already
  serves its session or serves nothing yet.

  A session that OpenCode attaches to, rather than creates, is also covered. The first event of such
  a run arrives before any session was created, and it now reaches the event plane instead of being
  dropped, so an attached session publishes from its first turn rather than staying silent until the
  next reset.

  Stopping a seat is now a teardown rather than an exit. The cooperative stop and the editor
  unloading the plugin run one shared routine, so neither can drift from the other, and it attempts
  the offline publish in front of the join rather than behind it: a supervised seat is hard killed after
  its runtime's grace window, so presence queued behind a long drain is the thing that gets lost.
  Queued event work is then given a bounded chance to settle inside whatever time the runtime leaves.

  Once that routine has begun, the connector starts no turn of its own, admits no hook work, and
  runs no `cotal_*` tool call. That first part now holds for a drive that was ALREADY PAST the check
  as well, which it did not before: the guards were read once, session creation was awaited, and
  nothing looked again, so a turn admitted while the seat was healthy could be submitted after
  departure had published. The phase condition is one predicate now, read on the way in and again on
  the way back from that await, and a drive refused there consumes nothing, so the batch is still in
  the inbox for a later wake in the same process.

  Separately, the operator's spawn prompt is no longer lost when something else gets in front of it.
  The boot task used to clear the prompt and then ask for a turn; if a natively submitted prompt had
  already made the session busy, that request returned early and the text was gone. The text is now
  cleared only once it has actually been submitted, and it counts as pending work everywhere the
  connector asks whether there is anything to drive, so being beaten to the session costs a retry
  rather than the prompt. What it does NOT do is cancel the editor. A hook steers
  OpenCode by mutating its `output` argument rather than by what it returns, and `chat.message`'s
  output carries no field that cancels or skips a turn, so a prompt submitted natively through the
  editor or its API still starts one. Whether that turn's events reach the plane is timing rather
  than a rule: the endpoint stays up until the end of the routine, so work already queued can still
  settle, while work arriving after the fence closes is refused. The refusals are stated as a condition on the state rather than as a list of the callers
  they cover, which is what let the earlier versions through: a turn could still be started by the
  deferred drive a swap fires when its own cutover completes, a late presence event could put a seat
  back on the mesh it had just left, and a tool call already inside the model's turn had no way to
  know a stop was running. A refused tool call says so rather than returning nothing, because its
  caller is waiting on a result and silence would read as a hang.

  The same loss had one more door, and that one is a failure rather than a refusal. Every refusal
  above leaves the drive through a guarded return, where the input it was carrying is put back by
  hand. A submission the host rejects leaves through the error path instead, and that path put nothing
  back. It looked safe only because most inputs are parked somewhere else already: the wake for an
  @mention in focus is not, because its body is acked at ingest and stays recallable while the wake
  itself lives only in the string handed to that one drive. So a rejected submission destroyed the
  wake, and the retry that exists for exactly this case then saw no pending work and did not run,
  leaving a seat that was never told to go and look. The error path now parks its input like every
  other exit, so a failed submission costs a retry rather than the wake.

  One slot, and one caller clearing another caller's wake. The three exits above each put their input
  back by hand, but they all put it in the SAME place, and the clear that runs after a successful
  submission sat on the far side of an await. A drive parked in session creation had read its input
  before that await; a second caller then reached the entry guard, parked its own wake in that slot and
  returned; and when the first call finally submitted, it emptied the slot on the strength of what IT
  had taken. That is a lost update across an await, and it destroyed a wake that arrived through
  exactly the guarded exit these changes exist to protect. The clear is now ownership checked, by
  generation rather than by value, because the nudge names the sender and not the message, so two
  mentions from one sender are byte identical and comparing them would report "still mine" about
  someone else's input.

  A wake could also be destroyed before it ever reached that slot. The handler for an @mention in
  focus declined to ask for a turn while one was already running, which is the right thing to do one
  handler above it, where the message is buffered in the inbox and the next turn picks it up. This
  one has nothing buffered behind it: the body is acked and dropped as it arrives, so the nudge is
  the only copy, and declining did not defer it, it discarded it. The turn then ended, found nothing
  pending, and the seat was never told it had been mentioned at all. That wake is now handed over
  whatever the seat is doing, so a busy seat parks it and drives it when the turn ends.

  What that does and does not promise, stated narrowly on purpose. It does NOT prevent message loss:
  an @mention in focus is acked at ingest, and where the channel permits replay its body stays
  recallable from the server, so the content was never riding on the wake. Where a channel denies
  replay, the body is gone by that channel's own policy and no wake can bring it back; the connector
  deliberately does not buffer it, because doing so would hand a seat in focus history that the
  channel refuses to everyone else. What this prevents is a caller's wake being erased, whether by an
  unrelated call's clear or by a handler that never passed it on. One slot is the design rather than
  a limit: a later wake overwriting an earlier one costs nothing, because any single wake that fires
  makes the seat pull its inbox and recover whatever that channel will give back, while emptying the
  slot entirely means no pull is ever triggered. The invariant is that at least one wake survives to
  fire, not that every wake is kept.

  Departure is also ordered behind the work the seat has already admitted, for as long as a short
  bound allows. A presence write is not atomic, so a call admitted before the stop could be parked
  mid-write while the teardown published offline, and then put the seat back to work after it had
  announced it left; on the wire, a roster read `working` after `offline`. The teardown now waits,
  briefly, for interactive work it has already admitted before it attempts departure, and joins the
  slower event work afterwards as it already did. Event work is deliberately not in that wait,
  because waiting on a drain is what publishing departure early exists to avoid.

  That wait is for the whole admitted set rather than for the first thing to happen to it, and it says
  so with `Promise.allSettled` rather than by absorbing each call by hand. The hand-rolled version was
  the same defect one level up: a map can absorb SOME elements, and a review proved by live mutation
  that absorbing only the two ends passed every cell the suite had at the time. The primitive waits for
  every element and never rejects, so partial absorption is no longer a state this code can be in.

  That wait is bounded below the shortest runtime grace window, which is what leaves room for
  departure to be published before a hard kill under ordinary conditions. It is a margin rather than
  a guarantee: the publish itself has no deadline, so a slow write in the time the bound leaves is
  lost with everything else the kill takes. The other tradeoff is stated rather than implied: a
  straggler that outlives the bound is not cancelled, so it can still complete after departure has
  been published.

  A wake that arrived before the boot prompt used to starve both of them, permanently and silently.
  The two share one slot: the boot text was carried only when that slot was empty, so a focus
  @mention landing while the boot task was still waiting for the session parked the nudge, and the
  boot task's own request then read that nudge, put it straight back and returned. Nothing could
  empty the slot afterwards, because emptying it takes a submission, a submission takes the boot text
  cleared, and clearing it takes the submission that had just been refused. The seat stayed online
  with nothing logged and no retry scheduled, and it went deaf: the spawn prompt, the wake, and every
  later connector-submitted turn including a directed message were all lost for the life of the
  process. Against the previous release this was a regression, which lost the wake and still
  submitted the boot. The two now go out together in one turn rather than competing for the slot. The
  boot floor says the operator's prompt is the first turn this connector submits, and a wake says
  only that the seat should go and look, so there is nothing to order between them.

  The event plane also gives back what a session took on disk, which is the other half of a `/new`
  and the half that is not visible on the wire. Two things are created for a session that publishes
  events and they have different lifetimes, so they are released differently.

  The principal lock is per principal and per workspace, shared by every session of that agent. It
  was taken and never given back: the connector read the location it came with and dropped the lock
  itself, so nothing in shipped code released one. The record then went on naming a process that was
  alive and no longer publishing, and a REPLACEMENT process for the same principal was refused its
  own event plane. It is now released at the final event teardown and only there, since a `/new`
  must keep it for the session that follows. Both ways out reach that teardown, so the editor
  unloading the plugin while its host keeps running releases it exactly as a supervised stop does.

  A session's write-ahead log is per session and its lifetime is stated rather than assumed, because
  a log exists so a later start can recover what was not yet published and deleting one early
  destroys exactly that. A retired session's log is removed once its run has been closed on the wire,
  AND the drain that closed it settled rather than spending its bound, AND the log holds no frame the
  broker never confirmed. Either of the last two keeps it, for different reasons that the connector
  distinguishes in what it logs: an abandoned drain is uncancelled and may still be writing, while a
  pending frame is the one thing only a later start reading that file can settle. The live session's
  log survives teardown, because a teardown is not a retirement: nothing has told an observer that
  thread ended, and a start that adopts it again is the case the log is for. So a process leaves one
  log directory behind rather than one per `/new`.

  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` gains a close on the emitter holder to go with that. Retiring a holder
  was a dropped reference rather than an act: it refused nothing afterwards, and a late hook could
  still start or pump an emitter its owner had finished with. Closing refuses admission and then
  joins what is already queued. It cancels nothing and releases no durable state, because the log's
  lifetime and the lock's are the connector's to decide and not the holder's.

### Minor Changes

- 17f8c57: OpenCode sessions publish AG-UI events, so a seat's work is readable by a program rather than only by a person.

  A session spawned with `--events` now publishes run boundaries, assistant text, reasoning and every
  tool call with its arguments, its end and its result, on `events.<owner>.<actor>`. Until now only
  Claude Code did; an OpenCode seat's event panel was empty.

  Migration: nothing is removed and no behaviour changes for a session that does not ask for events.
  A personal `opencode` with the plugin installed still publishes nothing, because arming is
  `COTAL_EVENTS` and the launcher sets it only for a `--events` spawn.

  Two limits are deliberate and documented. No user-authored text is published: OpenCode injects a
  peer batch by prepending it into the human's own text part, so one record holds both authors with no
  boundary in it to filter on, and guessing where one ends would fail open the moment either formatter
  changed. And no step events or usage numbers: OpenCode's step records carry no step name and no key
  shared between start and finish, and what the finish carries is cost and tokens, so emitting a step
  boundary would tell a reader that a phase ended when what happened is that counts arrived.

  One OpenCode process can hold several sessions, and `/new` is a context reset that keeps the mesh
  identity. Each session publishes under its own thread id on the one channel. The session being left
  is flushed and its open run is closed before the switch, so a reader is never left holding a run
  that never ends.

  The reader is the same on every connector, so the channel, the grant and how to subscribe are
  documented once in the Claude Code page and linked from the OpenCode one.

  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` is listed because the generated documentation bundle it carries is
  regenerated with the pages.

- a087c2b: A spawned agent now inherits the operator's environment. A harness you installed and configured
  should behave under `cotal spawn` the way it behaves when you run it yourself, and the alternative
  was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors: every new provider needed a change in Cotal
  before it would work through a managed spawn. `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEYS` and the per-connector lists
  that extended it are gone, and Cotal no longer names an inference vendor anywhere in its source.

  Cotal still resets its own `COTAL_*` namespace before the child starts, keeping the machine-wide
  knobs (`COTAL_HOME`, the feedback set, the default-agent pair, the `*_BIN` overrides, the timing
  knobs). That reset is not configurable, because it is identity and not preference: a connector
  supplies the per-session names for each child and does so conditionally, so an inherited value is
  never overwritten and would hand an agent another agent's credential path, ACL, or lifecycle uid.
  The whole prefix is stripped rather than a named list, because which names a connector sets varies
  between connectors and a deny-list only ever names what its author remembered.

  To confine a spawned agent instead, declare `spawn.env` in the cotal config file. The child then
  gets a fixed OS allow-list plus exactly the names you list. An empty array is a real policy meaning
  the OS allow-list alone. Note what this does and does not buy: `HOME` is forwarded either way, so
  an agent with a shell reads `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` regardless, and this protects only secrets that
  live nowhere but the environment.

- 34caaf4: Agent seats no longer export their connection material into the environment every descendant
  process inherits. The broker URL, the creds path, the auth token, the user-mode identity and the
  local control token now ride a private 0600 launch-material file whose path is the only thing in the
  seat's environment; pi, codex and OpenCode drop even that path once they have read it (for OpenCode
  that happens in the `opencode serve` process its seat shim starts, which is also what runs the
  session's tool calls), while claude and hermes keep the reference because their readers are
  short-lived children that start later. A session driven by hand still sets `COTAL_CREDS` / `COTAL_SERVERS` itself, and a
  launch that carries both carriers is refused rather than resolved by precedence.

### Minor Changes

- 57d3a57: A Claude session publishes a structured event plane, and the `tr-<name>` transcript mirror is
  retired

  A session launched with `cotal spawn --events` now actually publishes. The Claude connector maps
  its session records to structured events behind the same hook relay the mirror used to sit behind:
  run boundaries per turn, assistant text, reasoning, and each tool call with its arguments, its end
  and its result, written to a per-session write-ahead log before they go on the wire so a restart
  resumes at its cursor instead of replaying or skipping. Until now no connector constructed the
  emitter at all, so every event channel was empty.

  The `tr-<name>` mirror is removed in the same change rather than deprecated alongside it. Gone with
  it: the `--transcript` and `--no-transcript` flags on `cotal spawn`, the `transcript` field on the
  manager's spawn op and its service contract, `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT` and `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT`,
  `LaunchOpts.transcript`, `Connector.transcriptChannel`, and the mirror in all three connectors that
  carried one.

  MIGRATION. If you read a `tr-<name>` channel, nothing publishes to it any more. A managed session no
  longer mirrors its prose there under any flag or environment variable, and a spawn that passes
  `--transcript` now fails on an unknown flag rather than being ignored. Read the session's event
  channel instead: launch with `--events` and subscribe to `events.<owner>.<actor>`, which is keyed on
  the session's principal. On a static mesh that is `events.local.<key>`, where the key is what the
  manager allocated and the spawn reply carries it as `id`; on a user-auth mesh it is
  `events.<your-owner>.<agent-name>`, where the actor half is the agent's own name. `connect-claude.md`
  gives both forms. `cotal console` and the web console render event frames directly. Unlike
  `tr-<name>`, you cannot simply subscribe: the plane needs an out-of-band grant, and the command for
  it is under "To let something read a plane" below.

  What you gain and what you lose, both stated. A tool call now arrives with its full arguments, its
  end and its result, in a vocabulary a program can read, where the mirror gave a truncated one-liner
  of glyph-prefixed text. What you lose is prompt text somebody else wrote: the mirror republished
  every prompt, and the event plane withholds the body of a turn the agent did not author, because
  republishing a peer's message onto a channel that peer may not read crosses an ACL boundary. A
  peer-authored turn still opens a run and still shows the work it caused. One stated limit on that,
  because the loss column is only useful if it is complete: a tool result is this session's own output
  and is republished, so peer text quoted inside one still reaches the wire. A cell in
  `agui-authorship.smoke.ts` holds that as a measured limit rather than leaving it to be discovered.

  A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is creating, and no other. A spawn that names
  a different agent's event channel in `allowSubscribe` or `allowPublish` is refused at the door,
  because that channel carries the session's tool inputs and outputs. The same rule runs on a manager
  resume: a retained inventory naming another agent's event channel is refused rather than adopted.

  The rule reads a **concrete** channel, two principal tokens and nothing else. A pattern such as
  `events.<owner>.>` is not an event channel to it and passes untouched, governed by ordinary ACL
  authority. That is deliberate, since the pattern is the form an operator writes on purpose for an
  observer.

  To let something read a plane, grant it out of band. The refusal prints one command, spelled out in
  full, for the mesh it is running on. On a user-auth mesh:
  `cotal actor grant <reader> --owner <owner> --scope '' --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --allow-publish
''`, every field named because `actor grant` is an upsert of the whole row and an omitted flag is the
  wide default (`>` read, `>` post, `spawn,role:default` scope), not "leave it alone". On a static mesh there is no
  actor ledger for `actor grant` to write to, so mint the reader instead:
  `cotal mint watcher --profile agent --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --provision`, the agent profile and
  not the observer one, since `mint` reads `--allow-subscribe` only for that profile and refuses it off
  that profile.

  `cotal mint` now REFUSES `--allow-subscribe` / `--allow-publish` off the agent profile rather than
  ignoring them. Those profiles carry a FIXED read set, the chat plane for observer and the whole
  messaging plane for admin, so
  `--profile observer --allow-subscribe <one channel>` used to exit 0, print a success line, and hand
  out a credential that reads every channel in the space: an operator asking to narrow got the
  opposite, silently. `--role` and `--provision` were already refused there for the same reason. The
  rows in `cli.md` and the sentence in `build-a-client.md` now say the same thing.

## 0.20.0

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e8d776: The `cotal_*` tools now refuse an argument they do not model instead of silently
  dropping it. A call carrying an unmodelled key (`owner` or `actor` alongside the
  real arguments) previously succeeded with that key stripped before the tool ran,
  so the caller was told nothing and the tool did something other than what was
  asked. It is now refused by name, on every adapter and on every tool: the MCP
  renderers and pi publish a closed schema and the host rejects the call, while
  OpenCode and Hermes pass the caller's object through untouched and are closed at
  the connector's own dispatch. Tools that take no arguments are closed too: they
  were previously published with no schema at all, so a host had nothing to check
  against and forwarded the extras to be dropped, as is `cotal_inbox`, whose
  arguments four of the connectors replace with their own. Behaviourally breaking
  for any caller that was relying on extra keys being ignored. Every refusal names
  the rejected keys; where the connector is the one refusing it also lists the
  arguments the tool accepts, or says it takes none.

### Patch Changes

- 885c82e: `cotal spawn --agent opencode --prompt <text>` now submits that text as the session's first turn.
  The connector built its launch spec without ever reading the prompt, so an OpenCode seat accepted
  the flag, joined the roster, loaded its persona, and then sat idle until something else woke it.
  The prompt now rides the child environment to the in-process plugin, which submits it once, after
  the session exists and the mesh link is up, and never again on a later readiness event. Peer
  traffic that arrives during boot stays buffered and is delivered when that first turn ends, so the
  operator's prompt really is the first turn. An initial prompt with no text in it is refused at
  launch instead of being accepted and dropped.

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- d2333f1: The OpenCode plugin bundle is now closed over its runtime dependencies, so `cotal spawn --agent opencode` works from an installed extension. It previously kept a runtime import of `@opencode-ai/plugin` (a peer that `cotal ext add` never installs), which OpenCode could not resolve; it skips such a plugin silently, so the agent never joined the mesh and the launcher sat for 60s before aborting with "agent session never came up". The only use of that import was `tool()`, an identity function for type inference, so the tool definitions are now plain `ToolDefinition` literals and the import is type-only. The `@opencode-ai/*` bundler externals are gone as well, so a future value import is inlined rather than silently escaping the bundle.

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- a10ed79: OpenCode connector: mirror each agent's session transcript to its per-agent `tr-<name>` channel, event-driven from the plugin's in-process bus events (`message.updated` / `message.part.updated` / `session.idle`) — parity with the Claude connector, with no per-turn session refetch. The `tr-<name>` channel convention is exposed through the `Connector` contract (`Connector.transcriptChannel`) so the manager can grant the agent's publish ACL without the channel literal living in `@cotal-ai/core`, and the manager forwards control-plane `capabilities` (`COTAL_CAPABILITIES`) so a manifest-spawned agent exposes the `cotal_spawn` / `cotal_persona` tools its creds already authorize. Adds an end-to-end smoke for the mirror (`smoke:opencode-transcript`).

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

### Minor Changes

- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).

### Patch Changes

- 73b030f: Add the `cotal_feedback` sender: a connector tool (always exposed) and a `cotal feedback "<summary>"` CLI mode. With a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` feedback routes to the keyed broker intake as before; without one it goes to the public intake at `https://cotal.ai/v1/feedback`, which requires a contact email (`COTAL_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` → git config → ask). `COTAL_FEEDBACK_URL` overrides either URL for self-hosted intakes.

### Patch Changes

- 246c9b9: Add the OpenCode connector. It launches a watchable `opencode` TUI bound to the agent's session — a headless `opencode serve` with the mesh plugin loaded, plus a foreground `opencode attach --session <id>` — drives that visible session via `session.promptAsync`, and renders the `cotal_*` tools as native plugin tools at Claude-Code parity. The tool surface is extracted into `cotalToolSpecs` in connector-core so the Claude/Codex MCP adapters and the OpenCode plugin render the same tools.
