### Minor Changes

- 585fdb2: Connectors launch on the model and variant their launcher resolved. `LaunchOpts.model` and `LaunchOpts.variant` are now the launcher's resolved values (the flag, else the agent file's `model:` / `variant:`), and every connector renders them as given instead of reading the agent file again in `buildLaunch`. Before, a model the launcher did not resolve was taken from a later read of a file that could have changed since, so the seat could run a model the launcher never checked or recorded, and a supervised restart re-read it each time. The in-session config takes the model and variant from `COTAL_MODEL` / `COTAL_VARIANT` only, so the card and the orientation pin no longer report a model the seat was not launched on. The Hermes connector no longer falls back to `HERMES_MODEL` from the spawning process, including one `spawn.env` forwards; set the model with `--model` or the persona's `model:`. Code that calls `buildLaunch` directly must pass `model` and `variant` itself.

### Patch Changes

- b0ec4f9: The Hermes launcher now refuses a `COTAL_HERMES_ADOPT_HOME` that is not an absolute path, before it writes anything. A relative value used to resolve against whatever directory the launcher ran in, so the same setting installed the plugin into a different directory, or failed as missing, depending on where the seat started, and a literal `~/.hermes` that no shell expanded was taken as a directory named `~`. `docs/connect-hermes.md` now says the value must be absolute.
- f65b6c6: Say what lands in an adopted Hermes profile. `docs/connect-hermes.md` described `COTAL_HERMES_ADOPT_HOME` as leaving the profile as found apart from `plugins/cotal`, but the Hermes gateway records one-time hints under `onboarding.seen` by writing `config.yaml` back whole, which drops comments and can change its layout, and the launcher also writes `cotal-tools.json` there. The page now names both writes and gives the `onboarding.seen` flags to set so the gateway leaves `config.yaml` as written.
- 0d267ab: Stop two Hermes seats on one channel from answering each other in a loop. The Hermes gateway posts every turn's answer, and its own busy notices, back to the channel as a reply to the message that started the turn, and the connector started a turn on every channel message, so each seat's answer started a turn on the other and the chatter ran until the gateways stopped. On a Hermes seat a channel message that replies to another message now waits in `cotal_inbox` instead of starting a turn, unless it `@mention`s the seat. The new `channelRepliesPullOnly` field of the connector-core agent config applies the rule, and the Hermes sidecar sets it.
- 1e182e7: `docs/connect-hermes.md` now documents how a Hermes seat reaches a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint. A seat does not inherit the endpoint variables from your shell, and Hermes 0.19 reads `CUSTOM_BASE_URL` only when its provider is `custom`, so a managed profile needs `HERMES_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=custom` and `CUSTOM_BASE_URL` exported and listed in `spawn.env`. An endpoint that needs a key belongs in an adopted profile's `config.yaml` model block. The page also says that `--model custom:<model>` is passed to Hermes unchanged and does not select the provider, and its spawn commands now carry `--no-events`, because the connector publishes no AG-UI event plane and a launch that arms one is refused.
- 7614b7e: Remove a managed Hermes profile when its seat stops. `cotal stop` used to end the gateway and drop the seat while the generated `HERMES_HOME` stayed in the temp dir with the written config, the plugin copy and the state Hermes wrote, and Hermes's kanban database stayed beside it, so every stopped seat left a directory behind. Each managed seat now gets a temp root of its own, `$TMPDIR/cotal-hermes-<id>`, which also holds the gateway's `TMPDIR`. On stop the launcher sends the gateway SIGTERM, kills its process tree if it is still running 1.5 seconds later, waits for it to exit, and then removes the root, so nothing is deleted while the gateway can still write. A `--resume` seat's root is kept, because its profile holds the fork that a relaunch under the same name continues. A fork kept under the earlier root, `$TMPDIR/cotal-hermes-<space>-<name>`, moves into the seat's own root on its next launch, replacing a profile there that holds no fork, so it is still continued and still refuses a different session. An adopted profile (`COTAL_HERMES_ADOPT_HOME`) is never removed. `docs/connect-hermes.md` says where the managed profile lives and what a hard stop leaves behind.
- 4c3fbaf: Run a managed Hermes seat as a Hermes named profile under its temp root, so its gateway gets a systemd unit name of its own, `hermes-gateway-cotal-<id>`. Hermes used to read the managed temp home as a root and give the seat the bare `hermes-gateway` name of the operator's own gateway: the seat refused to start while the operator's gateway service was active, and every launch tried to rewrite the operator's `hermes-gateway.service` to point at the seat's temp profile.
- 569cb6f: The Hermes connector accepts `cotal spawn --resume <id>`. Before the seat joins the mesh, the launcher forks the named session out of the operator's Hermes profile (`HERMES_HOME`, or `~/.hermes`) into the seat's managed profile through Hermes' own session store, reading the source database read-only. The fork keeps the session's title, numbered `#N` the way `/branch` numbers a branch when the seat already holds that title from an earlier fork, and kept within Hermes' 100-character title limit. This works across the supported `hermes-agent` range, 0.18 included. Each mesh chat starts as a branch of that fork the first time the resumed seat uses it, so its first turn carries the source context; a chat holding history from an earlier seat of the same name moves to its branch too, and that history is kept under its own session. A missing or empty session is refused before the seat joins, a seat relaunched under the same name keeps its fork without reading the source again, and resume is refused together with `COTAL_HERMES_ADOPT_HOME`.
- b84dd9a: Replies now carry their correlation, so an answer reaches the Hermes session that asked. A `cotal_dm` to a peer answers the message its new `replyTo` argument names, or else the oldest DM or anycast that peer sent and that no DM back has answered yet, as long as that peer's waiting messages share one conversation; across several conversations the DM is refused with their ids rather than guessing. The reply names that message in `replyTo` and copies its `contextId` (SPEC §5), and the message counts as answered only once the reply is published; until then it still counts as waiting when a later DM to that peer has to pick what it answers. `MeshAgent.withCorrelation` stamps a per-call `contextId`, `replyTo` and conversation peer on the sends one call makes. A call bound to a message it answers copies that message's `contextId` when it names none. `MeshAgent.answersQuestion` tells whether a DM answers a question asked that way, from the peer it went to. The Hermes bridge's `tool` frame takes an optional `contextId` and `peerId`, its `reply` frame an optional `replyTo` and `contextId`, and an `incoming` frame carries `answersQuestion`. The Hermes plugin stamps each `cotal_dm` and `cotal_anycast` question with a `contextId` minted for it and runs the answer in the session that asked: a Cotal session directly, a session on another platform such as a Telegram topic through Hermes' `inject_message`, which the operator allows with `plugins.entries.cotal.allow_gateway_injection`. When the host refuses that injection or fails with an error, the answer is neither run in another session nor acknowledged: the new `deferred` bridge frame keeps it buffered and offers it again after 30 seconds. A turn's reply names the message the gateway says it answers. A question from a Cotal session records the session's chat type from its chat id, because not every supported Hermes version binds one for a tool call, so its answer runs in the session that asked rather than one keyed without a type. A `cotal_dm`'s own `replyTo` wins over the message a `withCorrelation` scope binds, both for the reply's correlation and for which message counts as answered.
- 569cb6f: A `--resume` seat's fork provenance is recorded on the manager. `LaunchSpec` gains `resumeRecordPath`, where a connector whose seat forks after launch has it record the source session id, the source title and a SHA-256 of the transcript it read; the Hermes and Jcode connectors declare it. The manager reads that record once the seat has written it, keeps it on the seat's resume document (an optional `resumed` field, so earlier documents still resume), and adds a `resume` object to the `ps`/`inspect` row (manager cluster revision 20). `cotal ps --wide` prints `forked from <id>` with the title and hash, and the Hermes and Jcode seats print the same facts when they fork. The Jcode fork now carries a count above 2^53 byte for byte instead of rounding it, refuses a count outside the u64 range by name, and refuses a fork record that is not an object by name.

## 0.58.0

### Patch Changes

- e5ee584: The Hermes Python client now acks a surfaced delivery under `recvKey`, the field the bridge matches, so each delivery is retired and the bridge no longer stops after the first automatic item of a gateway boot.
- a5327b4: The Hermes bridge now forwards an inbox item's `historical` flag to the sidecar, and the adapter frames a join-time backfill with the same `(history) ` prefix connector-core's `fmtItem` gives the other connectors, so a retained @mention replayed after a gateway restart no longer reads as a live request.

## 0.57.0

## 0.56.1

### Patch Changes

- 6b76946: A seat resumed from a preservation cut backfills its channels from the chat stream sequence its prior incarnation had reached instead of replaying the whole retained window.
- 8137d83: The Hermes bridge's local Unix-socket listener now authenticates the first frame of every connection against the launch's control token, dropping an unauthenticated or wrongly-tokened connection before it ever reaches the adapter or a tool call, and the Python-side client now presents that same token on every connect and reconnect.

## 0.50.1

### Patch Changes

- f1d8d84: A spawned Hermes seat on the managed profile now refuses to launch when no model was resolved.
  The managed profile is a temporary directory and does not read `~/.hermes`, so a model configured
  there is not used, and with no `--model`, no agent file `model:` and no ambient `HERMES_MODEL` the
  generated `config.yaml` carried no `model:` key at all. Hermes then chose a default of its own over
  a provider the operator may hold no key for. The seat still joined the mesh and still accepted a
  turn, so the first sign of it was a provider authentication error partway through that turn, whose
  advice pointed at the operator's own credentials.

  The refusal names the three inputs that set a model and `COTAL_HERMES_ADOPT_HOME` for running on
  the operator's own profile instead. It fires before the profile directory or the plugin is written, so a refused launch
  leaves nothing on disk, and it prints as one line rather than a stack. A launch with a model is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 6f248ac: Enumerate broker spawn sites so an unmigrated suite fails the gate instead of leaking

  The reaper claims a leaked `nats-server` by matching the store-dir token in its argv, and its header
  states the standing condition: it "is only ever as complete as the migration that mints the token".
  #1008 measured what that costs, 108 orphaned brokers on one box in a day, all holding loopback ports
  inside the OS ephemeral range that suites draw from. The five suites it named were migrated, and
  nothing was left behind that could notice the sixth.

  `pnpm smoke:broker-migration` is that missing piece. It names no filenames: it walks `git ls-files`,
  finds every call that starts a `nats-server`, and fails when one is not claimable by the reaper or
  killable by the teardown helper. A suite added next week is in the population on the commit that
  adds it. The census currently reads 319 spawn sites across 297 files, and the gate checks all 315
  that are in scope.

  The census found 98 unadopted sites, not five. Two conditions each break the chain on their own and
  both are now required: the token has to be in a path the broker is STARTED with, since the reaper
  reads argv and nothing else, and the handle has to reach `teardownOnSignal`, since the token only
  helps once the owner is dead. Three shapes were leaking for reasons a named list would never have
  surfaced. A suite minting a tokened store dir but launching with `-c <conf>` put the token somewhere
  argv never carries, so it was unclaimable despite looking migrated. Brokers started with neither
  `-sd` nor `-c` left no evidence at all; those now pass a tokened `-sd` purely as a marker, which
  `nats-server` accepts without JetStream and writes nothing into. And suites that owned one broker
  while leaving a sibling unowned read as clean under any file-level check, so ownership is decided per
  spawn site.

  A deliberate negative control opts out with a `SMOKE_BROKER_UNADOPTED_OK` marker, which is greppable
  and per-site rather than a silent exclusion: `reaper.smoke.ts` must be able to start an untokened
  broker, since that is the case it exists to detect.

  The teardown helper no longer stalls three seconds and then reports a false alarm on every green
  run. It waited on `process.kill(pid, 0)`, which keeps succeeding for a child that has been killed but
  not yet waited on, so a suite whose own `finally` kills the broker first left a zombie that read as
  alive until the deadline elapsed, and the helper then printed `did not exit before path cleanup`
  about a process that was already dead. Liveness now distinguishes a zombie from a running process,
  and a genuinely running broker is still waited on before its store dir is removed.

- b7e5942: A peer can no longer forge the framing of an auto-injected message

  The block that carries waiting peer messages into a turn interpolated the message body and the
  sender name raw, and the Hermes sidecar built the same shape by string concatenation. Both were
  forgeable the two ways the inbox reply used to be: a body carrying a newline produced a second item
  in the block, reading to the agent as a separate delivered message from a peer that never sent one,
  and a sender naming itself with a closing bracket ended the real attribution and opened a forged
  one. These frames are auto-injected rather than returned when the agent asks, so the agent never
  had a chance to distrust them.

  The rule both surfaces now hold is the one the inbox reply already held, and they hold it through
  the same code rather than a second convention: a line that begins at column zero is written by the
  connector, never by a peer. One message is one line plus indented continuations, with the
  attribution inside a single bracket pair. The neutralization moved into a shared module that the
  injected block and the inbox reply both render through, so the body, the sender name and role, and
  the service and channel labels all pass through one implementation. The Python sidecar carries a
  matching module, kept to the same character class on purpose, since a peer that can forge the frame
  on either side of the socket has the whole class back.

  Two widenings came out of stating the rule positionally rather than by example. The attribution
  class now neutralizes the opening bracket as well as the closing one, because stripping only the
  closing one still let a name render a bracket pair a reader takes as the innermost attribution. The
  injected block's per-item separator is the bracketed attribution the inbox reply uses, replacing the
  bullet, so the text of an injected block changed and the wake-path suites that assert on it were
  updated with it.

  A third injected surface holds the same rule now. A wake hint carries no message body and reads as
  one short sentence, so it does not look like a frame, but it is written into the agent's context
  without being asked for and it names a peer-controlled channel label, which three connectors
  interpolated raw. A label carrying a newline put a second line at column zero reading as another
  delivered message. That label renders through the shared module too, and the absent-channel fallback
  moved there with it, since three connectors each spelled it themselves and an absent field is what a
  per-call-site spelling is most likely to get wrong.

### Patch Changes

- 0a52594: Census the in-process half of the ambient-environment rule. `smoke:suite-ambient-env` grades the environment a suite hands a child; the new `smoke:suite-ambient-env-self` grades a suite that reads its own `process.env` through `configFromEnv` and friends, and requires a module-scope `COTAL_` prefix scrub before that first read. The connector suites in the class now scrub the whole prefix instead of dropping one variable, so running them from inside a connected session no longer dies in its own import on the one-identity-plane refusal.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.

### Minor Changes

- 34ff272: `cotal run`, the workflow-run operator surface, self-registered by `@cotal-ai/runtime` and composed
  into the `cotal` binary: `start --file <program>` drives a new run on the mesh handler, `resume
<runId> --file <program>` takes an existing run over and drives it to quiescence, `ps` lists an
  endpoint's run records (state, holder, journal high-water, fork lineage), `journal <runId>` prints
  the durable step journal, and `answer <runId> <stepKey> --by <who> [--value <json>]` resolves an
  open checkpoint through the run driver, presenting as the arming holder read back from the
  checkpoint record (resume is holder-bound). One raw connection per invocation against the resolved
  mesh target; the journal's result bound is taken from the broker's own max_payload.

  `docs/workflows.md` gains an "Operating a run" section, the connector docs bundle carries it, and
  every connector folds a workflow steer (`WORKFLOW_STEER`) into its agent instructions beside the
  mesh-first steer, so agents reach for a durable journalled run instead of improvising long
  coordination loops in their own context.

Host-session markers such as CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION no longer leak into seats and silently disable transcript saving. The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 569f4d3: An empty message id is never a dedup key, and an id-less delivery is individually addressable at the drain seam.

  Two distinct messages that each carry an empty id collapsed to one: the receiver-side id
  dedup read empty-equals-empty as a duplicate, silently dropped the second, and once the
  first was handled it dropped every later empty-id message on arrival. Measured live, two
  such messages arrived on the wire and only the first was ever delivered.

  An empty id is now treated as no id: the ingest coalescing (pending, handled, protected)
  is skipped for it in both directions, so distinct messages that carry an empty id are all
  delivered. At the drain seam a per-delivery receive key (the wire id when there is one, a
  per-session secret-namespaced minted key when the id is empty, never on any wire) is what
  hosts, adapters, and the exact-key drain select by: cotal_inbox, the Claude Code hooks,
  the OpenCode plugin, the Codex host, the Hermes bridge and its Python sidecar, and the pi
  driver. The drain API is renamed for what it takes (drainInboxDeliveries, missingKeys).
  Eviction classification, in-flight holds, scope routing, the focus-recall tie-break, and
  the scoped drain's selection no longer key on the empty id either. The Hermes bridge no
  longer wedges on an empty-id message. Delivery pumps in core now treat an absent or
  non-string id as a malformed envelope per SPEC section 5 (durable terminate, live drop,
  history and recall skip).

  What this restores: before the receive key, an id-less delivery was unaddressable: the
  raw id swept every pending empty-id item in one drain call, and once filtering closed
  that, the item could never be drained or acked, was re-shown on every windowed inbox
  read, and on a durable channel accumulated as an unretirable entry until the 200-entry
  overflow valve evicted it, roughly a model turn of churn per entry, while one hostile
  empty-id ambient publish self-drove back-to-back host turns on the pi adapter. This was
  a violation of the SPEC section 8 ack-only-after-surfaced obligation at the receiver,
  not only an adapter defect.

  The cost is stated rather than hidden: with no id there is no coalescing either, so a
  redelivered copy of an empty-id message can surface twice on a path that is already
  at-least-once (live remains at-most-once). Dedup for real ids is unchanged: their
  receive key is their wire id and their coalescing is untouched. SPEC section 4, section
  7 item 5, section 8, and section 12 item 12 now state the receiver-scoped rule, and the
  client-builder guidance mirrors it.

  One named follow-up stays open: Plane-3 durable fan-out derives its publish msgID from
  the message id, so distinct empty-id messages can still be collapsed inside the broker's
  duplicate window on a durable channel before this receiver sees them. That path is its
  own issue; this change's guarantee is the receiver.

### Minor Changes

- b31d2af: Drop `NEBIUS_API_KEY` from the model-provider allow-list. How a harness authenticates to an
  inference provider is the harness's business, not Cotal's: OpenCode, Codex, and Hermes each
  have their own provider config and credential store, and Cotal carrying a per-vendor env name
  meant every new inference provider needed a change here to work through a managed spawn. The
  Token Factory operator guide goes with it.
- a087c2b: A spawned agent now inherits the operator's environment. A harness you installed and configured
  should behave under `cotal spawn` the way it behaves when you run it yourself, and the alternative
  was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors: every new provider needed a change in Cotal
  before it would work through a managed spawn. `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEYS` and the per-connector lists
  that extended it are gone, and Cotal no longer names an inference vendor anywhere in its source.

  Cotal still resets its own `COTAL_*` namespace before the child starts, keeping the machine-wide
  knobs (`COTAL_HOME`, the feedback set, the default-agent pair, the `*_BIN` overrides, the timing
  knobs). That reset is not configurable, because it is identity and not preference: a connector
  supplies the per-session names for each child and does so conditionally, so an inherited value is
  never overwritten and would hand an agent another agent's credential path, ACL, or lifecycle uid.
  The whole prefix is stripped rather than a named list, because which names a connector sets varies
  between connectors and a deny-list only ever names what its author remembered.

  To confine a spawned agent instead, declare `spawn.env` in the cotal config file. The child then
  gets a fixed OS allow-list plus exactly the names you list. An empty array is a real policy meaning
  the OS allow-list alone. Note what this does and does not buy: `HOME` is forwarded either way, so
  an agent with a shell reads `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` regardless, and this protects only secrets that
  live nowhere but the environment.

- 34caaf4: Agent seats no longer export their connection material into the environment every descendant
  process inherits. The broker URL, the creds path, the auth token, the user-mode identity and the
  local control token now ride a private 0600 launch-material file whose path is the only thing in the
  seat's environment; pi, codex and OpenCode drop even that path once they have read it (for OpenCode
  that happens in the `opencode serve` process its seat shim starts, which is also what runs the
  session's tool calls), while claude and hermes keep the reference because their readers are
  short-lived children that start later. A session driven by hand still sets `COTAL_CREDS` / `COTAL_SERVERS` itself, and a
  launch that carries both carriers is refused rather than resolved by precedence.

### Patch Changes

- 219d33c: `cotal spawn --agent pi --prompt <text>` now delivers the prompt as Pi's initial message (its first turn) instead of silently dropping it; an empty prompt, or one starting with `-` or `@`, refuses the launch. The connector contract no longer describes an initial prompt as something a connector may ignore: a connector delivers it or throws at launch. The other connectors follow the same rule: Claude Code and Codex refuse a prompt that is empty after trimming instead of dropping it, and Hermes refuses an initial prompt outright until its first turn is wired.

### Minor Changes

- 4e8d776: The `cotal_*` tools now refuse an argument they do not model instead of silently
  dropping it. A call carrying an unmodelled key (`owner` or `actor` alongside the
  real arguments) previously succeeded with that key stripped before the tool ran,
  so the caller was told nothing and the tool did something other than what was
  asked. It is now refused by name, on every adapter and on every tool: the MCP
  renderers and pi publish a closed schema and the host rejects the call, while
  OpenCode and Hermes pass the caller's object through untouched and are closed at
  the connector's own dispatch. Tools that take no arguments are closed too: they
  were previously published with no schema at all, so a host had nothing to check
  against and forwarded the extras to be dropped, as is `cotal_inbox`, whose
  arguments four of the connectors replace with their own. Behaviourally breaking
  for any caller that was relying on extra keys being ignored. Every refusal names
  the rejected keys; where the connector is the one refusing it also lists the
  arguments the tool accepts, or says it takes none.

### Patch Changes

- c1fc62a: Fix the Hermes connector when it runs as an installed extension: `dist/launch.js` now
  carries a `createRequire` banner (the esbuild ESM bundle crashed at import with `Dynamic
require of "crypto"` on every installed-ext launch; dev runs via tsx masked it), and the
  launch-env filter now forwards Hermes' own model-provider API keys (`OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`,
  `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY`, `NOVITA_API_KEY`, and the other dedicated key names in the hermes
  0.16 provider registry, bundled model-provider plugins included) so a managed or
  containerized Hermes can authenticate any of its providers from the operator's
  environment. Generic cross-tool and cloud-wide credentials (`GH_TOKEN`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, …) stay excluded from the forward list.

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

### Patch Changes

- 1935221: Ship the built-in agent connectors (claude, opencode, hermes, pi) as removable `cotal ext` plugins. They are seeded on first run through the same `ext add` path a third party uses, resolved lazily per spawn, and deletable with `cotal ext remove`; they are no longer hardcoded imports or dependencies of `cotal-ai`.

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

  - Rework the CLI around dispatcher-parsed commands, operator-installed extensions (`cotal ext`), and extension-packaged web/demo surfaces.
  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

- c74007a: connector-hermes: Docker-aware install, and stop leaving duplicate sidecars.

  `npx @cotal-ai/connector-hermes install` now finds Hermes on its own: `hermes` on PATH (host),
  else a running Hermes container (copy the plugin into the bind-mounted `HERMES_HOME` or `docker
cp`, rewrite a loopback `COTAL_SERVERS` to `host.docker.internal`, and `plugins enable` inside the
  container), else `--target-home <path>` for a files-only placement. `uninstall` is symmetric and
  removes only the `COTAL_*` keys it manages.

  The standalone sidecar now watches the exact pid of the gateway that launched it
  (`COTAL_PARENT_PID`) instead of a racy parent-pid check, so the official image's transient boot
  gateway no longer leaves an orphan sidecar advertising a phantom peer. Also resolves Node from
  PATH or the bundled `<HERMES_HOME>/node`, and ignores the host's extra tool-call kwargs so the
  `cotal_*` tools stop erroring.
