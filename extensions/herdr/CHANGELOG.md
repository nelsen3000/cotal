### Patch Changes

- 5f13124: Private launch files now have an owner. The Claude persona file, the Claude shared-server MCP config file and the pi persona file are listed on the new `LaunchSpec.artifacts`, and the launcher removes them once it has proved the agent process gone. On the default pty runtime the manager removes them when it sees the agent exit; on tmux, cmux, orca and herdr the manager removes them by polling the seat's status and waiting for the runtime's exit proof; the foreground `cotal spawn` removes them when its child exits. Every one of those launches also starts its child through the new core `reclaimWithChild`: a watcher started beside the child removes the files once the child's process is gone, and tries a failed removal again every five seconds until it succeeds, so a killed manager or foreground `cotal spawn` no longer strands them (POSIX; Windows has no shell for the watcher). Each directory name carries a random per-launch identity, so a stale path can never name a later launch's directory. The tmux, cmux, orca and herdr runtimes now throw the new core `SpawnRefused` for an unsafe name, an unreachable backend, (herdr) a missing working directory or an unknown layout, (orca) a working directory that is missing or outside any Orca worktree, and a launcher script they cannot write or (tmux, herdr) a session or server that will not start, all before the agent's command is handed to the backend, and the manager removes the files at once. A removal that fails, after an exit or after a refusal, is tried again until it succeeds. A batch resume removes the files of specs it built and never launched. Both connectors now refuse a bad model, prompt or launch option before writing anything. Any other spawn that throws is not proof that nothing started, so its files stay for the child's watcher, or for the OS temp reaper when no child started, as do a killed launcher's on Windows. A seat started under a custodian with `launchSeat` from `@cotal-ai/seat`, which the manager no longer does for a new launch, hands them to that custodian: a launch it refuses before any process started removes them at once, the custodian removes them when it sees the agent exit, a removal that fails stays on the custody record, and a reap that proves the seat gone removes what the record still lists from the temp dir the launch wrote to, so a successor with a different `TMPDIR` still removes them. Losing a custodian's connection no longer counts as the agent's exit. The docs now say that owner-private means any process running as the same user can read the file while it exists.

### Minor Changes

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.

### Minor Changes

- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.

### Patch Changes

- 31443f1: Make package-filtered test commands run counted assertions instead of succeeding without tests.

### Minor Changes

- b519e73: Add the Herdr integration: a new `@cotal-ai/herdr` extension with a self-registering `herdr` Runtime provider that spawns managed agents into panes of a dedicated named Herdr session (`cotal-<space>`), where the Herdr server owns them — so they survive the manager's terminal going away. Requires herdr >= 0.8.0, enforced by a version check rather than a bare binary probe, so an older herdr reports the runtime as unavailable instead of advertising it and then failing every spawn.

  Each agent gets its own workspace and name-labeled tab by default (`COTAL_HERDR_LAYOUT=split` folds them into one shared tab). A spawn is `workspace create` + `pane run "exec …"`, then a bounded wait on the real process table — `pane run` types into a shell, so a delivered keystroke is not proof that anything started. The `exec` is load-bearing: without it the pane's shell outlives the agent and no exit could be proven. Lifecycle is keyed by Herdr's stable `terminal_id` with the public pane id re-resolved per operation off the session-wide pane inventory; creds ride an owner-only launcher script, never herdr's command line or its native `--env` (which lands in pane scrollback); every CLI call is scoped with `--session`.

  Spawned agents do not appear in Herdr's Agents sidebar: 0.8.0 reserves that registry for recognized agent kinds attached to an existing pane, so an arbitrary launcher is never one. They are identified by tab label and a `cotal` metadata token on the pane.

  The CLI lists `herdr` among the official runtimes (`cotal runtimes`, `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/herdr`), and CI now installs herdr so the extension's smoke suite actually gates rather than silently skipping.
