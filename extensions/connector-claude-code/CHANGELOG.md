## 0.69.0

## 0.68.0

### Minor Changes

- 585fdb2: Connectors launch on the model and variant their launcher resolved. `LaunchOpts.model` and `LaunchOpts.variant` are now the launcher's resolved values (the flag, else the agent file's `model:` / `variant:`), and every connector renders them as given instead of reading the agent file again in `buildLaunch`. Before, a model the launcher did not resolve was taken from a later read of a file that could have changed since, so the seat could run a model the launcher never checked or recorded, and a supervised restart re-read it each time. The in-session config takes the model and variant from `COTAL_MODEL` / `COTAL_VARIANT` only, so the card and the orientation pin no longer report a model the seat was not launched on. The Hermes connector no longer falls back to `HERMES_MODEL` from the spawning process, including one `spawn.env` forwards; set the model with `--model` or the persona's `model:`. Code that calls `buildLaunch` directly must pass `model` and `variant` itself.

### Patch Changes

- bdb0132: The Claude connector now finds a session's `/rename` title when the transcript row spells its type with a JSON escape, such as `"custom\u002dtitle"`. Before, such a row was skipped: a detached `--resume <name>` naming that title went to the manager host as an id instead of being refused, the carried title was missing, and a later rename written that way lost to an earlier one. Every transcript line is now parsed before its type is read.
- 33be936: A Claude Code seat no longer re-prints the wake nudge for a DM it already announced each time JetStream redelivers that DM. While one long tool call kept the hook drain from running, an unacked DM was redelivered every 60s and every copy queued another identical "New dm" notice, so a 51-minute call left about 50 of them per message. The connector now nudges once per message until a hook frame carries it, including a message first counted in a batch notice, and a redelivery after a frame whose reply never reached Claude Code still nudges again, even when the original nudge was still queued behind a full stdout. The retry after a rejected nudge follows the same rule: it counts only messages no live nudge announces, and a rejection that a newer nudge already superseded is not retried. `MeshAgent.pendingWake` takes an optional predicate that leaves out items the caller has already woken the session for.
- 681c5b0: A supervised Claude seat whose directory the manager host's own Claude does not trust is now refused before it launches, with an error that names the directory and Claude's workspace-trust dialog. Claude opens such a directory on that dialog, whose default answer exits, so the seat used to die on launch with only `EntertoconfirmEsctocancel` as its last output. Trust is read as Claude reads it: a parent directory's trust counts up to the root of the directory's own Git repository, and a linked worktree shares its main checkout's trust. The manager passes the seat's directory to the connector as the new `LaunchOpts.cwd`, so a spawn, a supervised restart and a preserved-seat resume are all checked. A foreground `cotal spawn` still shows the dialog in the operator's terminal. A carried resume uses the same check.

## 0.67.0

### Minor Changes

- f389576: `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` carries a Claude session held on the operator's host to a manager on another host, as `docs/design/resume-transfer.md` lays out. The CLI finds the transcript with the connector's new `resumeTranscript` locator and writes it into a JetStream Object Store bucket owned by the target instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, as a chain that an interrupted carry continues. The manager's new operator-only `transcript-receive` command stages it, removes the broker object, and issues a one-time `resumeClaim` that `spawn` consumes; a re-run of the same bytes moves none. The seat forks the transcript in a seat-private Claude home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps --wide` names the source host, session, digest and carry time. The manager cluster document moves to revision 21. Two one-shot credentials carry it on an authenticated mesh: a `transfer-writer` the CLI mints from the space's signing seed for the one transcript it hashed, or on a user-auth mesh exchanges from the operator's login as the new `transfer-writer` view (scope `admin`), and a `transfer-reader` the target manager mints for its own bucket on each receive or sweep, or that the host issues a remote manager through the new manager-service `transferReader` operation. A carried seat records the digest of the transcript Claude forked, and the manager stops a seat whose record does not match the carried bytes, including one whose launch was uncertain and that joined later. Space deletion lists the transfer buckets and deletes them: `deleteSpace` given the space's trust material mints its own `teardown` naming them, and it now throws naming every stream it could not delete instead of reporting success. The console space picker deletes a space this host registered as a static-auth mesh that way. The `transfer-writer` view, and the broker connection minted from it, lives at most five minutes, the static credential's lifetime.

### Patch Changes

- 7f909a1: Remove sentences from the AG-UI holder and the Claude Code and OpenCode AG-UI mapper comments that described what earlier revisions of those comments got wrong. The comments now state only the current contract: the `boundPath` gate keeps start-once, the chain serializes hook events, the refusals live in `subject-frontier.ts` and `event-wal.ts`, the bracket interleave is open, OpenCode publishes `RUN_ERROR` through `AguiEmitterHolder.closeRun`, and the Claude Code mapper keeps its measured predicate counts. No behavior changes.
- 8e0c2a3: Remove comment passages from the connector-core event WAL and the Claude Code AG-UI mapper that narrated earlier revisions of those comments, who flagged them, and the session they were written in. The `bindSubjectFrontier` doc ends at its contract, the temp-file write keeps its `O_EXCL`, `O_NOFOLLOW`, random suffix and `0600` rationale, and the mapper header states its measurement directly: 67 runs and 5217 events on the 5938-record session, with `diagnose()` returning `null`. No behavior changes.

## 0.66.1

### Patch Changes

- abddc24: The Claude Code connector now leaves the mesh when its stdin closes. An MCP client closes the server's stdin to end the session, and a killed `claude` closes it without firing `SessionEnd`. The connector used to keep running after either, held open by its mesh connection, so it kept heartbeating presence and every peer's `cotal_roster` showed the dead session as a live peer indefinitely. It now stops on stdin end as it does on SIGTERM, publishing `offline` before it exits.

## 0.65.0

## 0.64.0

### Minor Changes

- d121d21: Design record for carrying a detached `cotal spawn --resume <id> --detach --on <instance>` session to a manager on another host (`docs/design/resume-transfer.md`). The transcript moves through a per-space JetStream Object Store bucket for the target manager instance, in chunks sized to the broker's `max_payload`, with a chunk chain that resumes an interrupted upload and a content-addressed staging copy that makes a repeat move no bytes. The manager gains the operator-only `transcript-receive` command and `spawn` gains a one-time `resumeClaim`. The carried transcript is placed in a seat-private Claude config home that authenticates with an environment credential, and `cotal ps` and `cotal attach` show where a seat was resumed from. The implementation follows this record in the same change.

## 0.63.0

### Patch Changes

- 9d5cc09: First-run `cotal setup` now shares your own Claude Code MCP servers with the sessions Cotal spawns. It copies the user-scope servers from your Claude Code config into the cotal config's `connectors.claude.mcpServers` and names them in its output, so a spawned session has the tools you know plus the cotal tools. Before this, a spawned session loaded only the cotal server and setup never said why. With none to copy it writes an empty list, and a cotal config that already declares that list keeps it. A server with an `env` or `headers` value that is anything but `${VAR}` references is left out and named, because the cotal config keeps secrets only as `${VAR}` references. So is an entry no session can start, such as one with a missing or empty `command` or `url`, or one whose `command` is not a string. For a lighter seat, remove entries from the cotal config or spawn with `--share-tools none`. Connector setup providers gain an optional `mcpServers` action whose `seed` input the CLI binds to workspace's new `seedConnectorServers`, which writes under a lock so two setups run at once record one list. Core exports `readCotalConfigFile` and the `ConnectorShareSetupInput` type, and connector-core exports the `ENV_REFERENCE` pattern it already used.

## 0.62.0

## 0.61.0

### Patch Changes

- 8a9d279: The repo now carries an installable Claude Code plugin tree under `claude-plugin/`. Each release regenerates it with the built MCP and hook bundles, the `team-topology` skill, a README and the license, and stamps both plugin manifests with the release version, so an install from the repo's marketplace or from a pinned commit runs without a build and updates with each release. The marketplace at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now points at that tree. Both plugin manifests also gain `homepage`, `repository`, `license` and `keywords`.

## 0.60.0

## 0.59.0

### Patch Changes

- bdaa187: Keep the Claude Code connector's MCP server answering in a plain session. With no `COTAL_NAME`, `COTAL_LINK` or `COTAL_AGENT_FILE` it used to exit before `initialize`, so every plain `claude` with the plugin installed showed `Connection closed` and an MCP introspection check such as Glama's saw no tools. It now serves one static `cotal_how_to_join` tool over stdio and still stays off the mesh: no mesh agent, no broker connection and no control socket.
- cfc3b95: `cotal status` now has one Machine row per installed connector instead of fixed `Claude` and `OpenCode` rows. Each row reports whether the executables that connector declares in `requires` are on PATH, so a machine running Codex, jcode, pi or Hermes sees its harness. The `Claude plugin` and `Claude skills` rows now come from the Claude Code connector: a setup provider may declare a read-only `status`, and `cotal status` and the setup card print the rows it returns. A machine without the Claude connector no longer shows them. The extensions manifest caches each connector's setup ref, so status imports only connectors that declare a provider, and the seed reconcile refreshes a seeded entry whose cache predates it instead of checking the Claude connector by name. The debug handoff that `cotal setup` offers when a step fails now comes from connectors: a setup provider may declare an `assist`, and the menu offers one `Debug it with <harness>` option for each present connector that declares one. The Claude Code connector declares the existing Claude handoff. When no connector can host a handoff, the menu says so instead of silently omitting the option.
- 608f5f4: Re-attach doc comments that had drifted away from the declarations they document. A `/** */` block followed directly by another one documented nothing, so editor hovers and the published type declarations showed no doc for the intended declaration (for example `Manager`, the `plane3` field and `AclResolver`). Each such block now sits above its declaration, is merged into the block it duplicated, or is removed when its declaration no longer exists. A new `pnpm check:doc-comments` check, run as part of `check:docsbundle`, refuses a doc block followed directly by another in shipped source.
- 8316efb: A Claude Code hook that throws after it has started to surface peer messages no longer acks them. The empty reply it returns carries nothing, so the batch stays un-acked and reaches the model on a later frame. The seat also drops `turn-pending` rows that break the manager contract, such as one with no integer deadline, which used to make every hook frame throw. A `turn-pending` reply with no `turns` array leaves the seat's known turns in place.
- 5f13124: Private launch files now have an owner. The Claude persona file, the Claude shared-server MCP config file and the pi persona file are listed on the new `LaunchSpec.artifacts`, and the launcher removes them once it has proved the agent process gone. On the default pty runtime the manager removes them when it sees the agent exit; on tmux, cmux, orca and herdr the manager removes them by polling the seat's status and waiting for the runtime's exit proof; the foreground `cotal spawn` removes them when its child exits. Every one of those launches also starts its child through the new core `reclaimWithChild`: a watcher started beside the child removes the files once the child's process is gone, and tries a failed removal again every five seconds until it succeeds, so a killed manager or foreground `cotal spawn` no longer strands them (POSIX; Windows has no shell for the watcher). Each directory name carries a random per-launch identity, so a stale path can never name a later launch's directory. The tmux, cmux, orca and herdr runtimes now throw the new core `SpawnRefused` for an unsafe name, an unreachable backend, (herdr) a missing working directory or an unknown layout, (orca) a working directory that is missing or outside any Orca worktree, and a launcher script they cannot write or (tmux, herdr) a session or server that will not start, all before the agent's command is handed to the backend, and the manager removes the files at once. A removal that fails, after an exit or after a refusal, is tried again until it succeeds. A batch resume removes the files of specs it built and never launched. Both connectors now refuse a bad model, prompt or launch option before writing anything. Any other spawn that throws is not proof that nothing started, so its files stay for the child's watcher, or for the OS temp reaper when no child started, as do a killed launcher's on Windows. A seat started under a custodian with `launchSeat` from `@cotal-ai/seat`, which the manager no longer does for a new launch, hands them to that custodian: a launch it refuses before any process started removes them at once, the custodian removes them when it sees the agent exit, a removal that fails stays on the custody record, and a reap that proves the seat gone removes what the record still lists from the temp dir the launch wrote to, so a successor with a different `TMPDIR` still removes them. Losing a custodian's connection no longer counts as the agent's exit. The docs now say that owner-private means any process running as the same user can read the file while it exists.

## 0.56.0

## 0.55.0

### Patch Changes

- a13c8bb: Capture the event plane's start boundary at adopt instead of at the emitter's first read, so a complete record written while the connector is still starting up (the mesh wait, log open, and preflight) is no longer silently dropped. Claude Code and OpenCode both wrap their session source with the shared `BoundStartSource`.
- de989c0: The events-arm smoke asserts the connector's event channel is core's function by identity, so a clone that agrees on one sample is caught.
- d284ee6: A manifest or spawn prompt on a connector that cannot deliver one is refused at preflight (including `up -f --dry-run`), at spawn and in the manager, the way an unsupported model variant is: connectors now declare `supportsPrompt`, and claude, opencode, codex, jcode and pi declare it; hermes keeps its launch-time throw as the second line of defence.

## 0.52.0

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 64d723e: Enable the AG-UI event plane by default for connectors that publish one. Operators and peer spawns
  can opt out explicitly, while connectors without an event plane refuse unless that opt-out is set.
- ec8649b: Preserve the closed required-events registration policy and enforce it across discovery, launch,
  grant coverage, direct connector sessions, and trusted upgrades of existing manual registrations.

### Patch Changes

- 0a03e3e: Wait for a forked Claude session's transcript before the first event read. Claude copies the parent
  transcript into the fork's own file after its SessionStart hook, so the connector's first flush could
  open a file that did not exist yet and silence the session's event plane for good. The fork path now
  waits for the file with the startup path's bounded deadline and still adopts at the copied history's
  end.
- 4dd4b90: Add harness-reported presence conditions, opaque environment references, binding diagnostics, and compact roster rendering.

## 0.50.1

## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- b7e5942: A peer can no longer forge the framing of an auto-injected message

  The block that carries waiting peer messages into a turn interpolated the message body and the
  sender name raw, and the Hermes sidecar built the same shape by string concatenation. Both were
  forgeable the two ways the inbox reply used to be: a body carrying a newline produced a second item
  in the block, reading to the agent as a separate delivered message from a peer that never sent one,
  and a sender naming itself with a closing bracket ended the real attribution and opened a forged
  one. These frames are auto-injected rather than returned when the agent asks, so the agent never
  had a chance to distrust them.

  The rule both surfaces now hold is the one the inbox reply already held, and they hold it through
  the same code rather than a second convention: a line that begins at column zero is written by the
  connector, never by a peer. One message is one line plus indented continuations, with the
  attribution inside a single bracket pair. The neutralization moved into a shared module that the
  injected block and the inbox reply both render through, so the body, the sender name and role, and
  the service and channel labels all pass through one implementation. The Python sidecar carries a
  matching module, kept to the same character class on purpose, since a peer that can forge the frame
  on either side of the socket has the whole class back.

  Two widenings came out of stating the rule positionally rather than by example. The attribution
  class now neutralizes the opening bracket as well as the closing one, because stripping only the
  closing one still let a name render a bracket pair a reader takes as the innermost attribution. The
  injected block's per-item separator is the bracketed attribution the inbox reply uses, replacing the
  bullet, so the text of an injected block changed and the wake-path suites that assert on it were
  updated with it.

  A third injected surface holds the same rule now. A wake hint carries no message body and reads as
  one short sentence, so it does not look like a frame, but it is written into the agent's context
  without being asked for and it names a peer-controlled channel label, which three connectors
  interpolated raw. A label carrying a newline put a second line at column zero reading as another
  delivered message. That label renders through the shared module too, and the absent-channel fallback
  moved there with it, since three connectors each spelled it themselves and an absent field is what a
  per-call-site spelling is most likely to get wrong.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.

### Patch Changes

- f4672fd: Generate the Claude Code marketplace manifest with object plugin entries

  `cotal setup` wrote `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `plugins` as bare names. Claude Code
  validates that form, so `plugin marketplace add` and `plugin marketplace update` both report
  success, and the install then fails with `Plugin "cotal" not found in marketplace "cotal-mesh"`.
  The message points at a stale local copy rather than at the manifest, so the suggested
  `marketplace update` changes nothing, and re-running setup regenerates the same file over a hand
  repair. Setup pauses at that step, so later steps including persona seeding never run.

  Each present plugin is now listed as an object carrying `name`, `source` and the `description`
  read from that plugin's own `plugin.json`.

- 9a334ae: Honor connector-declared startup confirmation prompts in PTY seats by matching normalized terminal output, pressing Enter only when the prompt appears, and failing with a named bounded error when it does not.

### Minor Changes

- a87709c: Every cotal-lang effect now performs on the mesh: the durable-action group is built end to end and
  the not-yet-durable seam is gone.

  `spawn` submits a real manager goal and returns the allocated seat's handle, and meters the
  agent's `permits` (`turns`, `wallClock`; the turn that would exceed one is L4001, and a budget the
  host cannot meter is refused at spawn); `conclave` opens a scoped sub-team as durable membership
  rows; `ask` parks schema-checked pauses answered through `cotal run answer` and tells the agent
  over the turn relay, one relay per attempt carrying the schema, the attempt and the previous
  refusal, which every connector's intake renders with the answer command; `monitor` registers the
  handle on its journal entry and `wait(down)` reads a monitored incarnation's death off presence
  liveness, refusing an agent nobody monitored.
  `turn` rides a new pull-shaped manager relay: the manager serves `turn` (targeted, the
  despawn/input reach) plus `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` (self reach, manager contract revision
  10), holds the payload on the goal-index note, pins the goal to the seat's incarnation, and denies
  at a goal-bound deadline hold; the seat side (all connectors) pulls pending turns, surfaces them
  two-phase into host context, auto-yields `done` when the host turn ends, and yields `blocked` or
  `handoff` through the new `cotal_yield` tool; the run client renders context with pending notices,
  arms its own pause on the acceptance's deadline as the L4003 authority, watches presence as the
  L4002 authority (a death the manager marks on the deadline terminal reads the same way), and
  honors handoffs (L4005/L4004 validation, the `handoffFrom` goal chain); the manager shows a seat
  one turn at a time. The relay holds on an auth mesh: the agent baseline gains the self-mode
  `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` rows, the operator seat-write set (`control-caller-admin`, the
  `admin` capability) gains `turn` beside `input`, and the manager mints the deadline hold's
  schedule over its serve connection and owner-expires the hold once due instead of reading a
  fire it holds no grant for. `wait(replied)` observes the run's own turn terminals as a level, and never a
  turn the run itself ended without an accepted yield. A `spawn` may bind a logical worktree: the
  validator rejects two literal-worktree spawns in one concurrent scope (L3022, named branch
  functions included) and the runtime claims a tree before it submits, refusing a second spawn into
  a tree held by a live seat or by a spawn in flight (L4008), with sequential reuse the moment the
  holder's presence lapses. A spawn refused at accept is L4000 (L4001 for seat capacity) and one
  whose seat never came up is L4002; an `ask` whose deadline passes with no conforming record is
  L4006; a fork copies a spawn that said `onFork: "adopt"` and refuses one that would have to
  respawn (L5019). The run driver re-issues
  recorded-but-undischarged cancellations at adoption, so recovery does not wait for completion to
  release a dead loser's seat, pause, or tree. A migration's `--adopt <handle>` hands the orphaned
  seat to the edited program's next spawn of that persona, and `--release <handle>` despawns it at
  commit through the run's own discharge; both name the agent the step spawned, and a spawn that
  produced none is an orphan like a sleep; the adopting spawn binds the orphaned spawn's goal as
  its own, so a resume re-reads the seat and a cancellation despawns it. A turn accept the manager
  cannot finish unwinds to a failed terminal on its bound goal, and a retry of it is refused naming
  that terminal. The delivery daemon hosts the checkpoint timer writer, so mediated deadlines fire
  with no suite pump.

### Minor Changes

- 34ff272: `cotal run`, the workflow-run operator surface, self-registered by `@cotal-ai/runtime` and composed
  into the `cotal` binary: `start --file <program>` drives a new run on the mesh handler, `resume
<runId> --file <program>` takes an existing run over and drives it to quiescence, `ps` lists an
  endpoint's run records (state, holder, journal high-water, fork lineage), `journal <runId>` prints
  the durable step journal, and `answer <runId> <stepKey> --by <who> [--value <json>]` resolves an
  open checkpoint through the run driver, presenting as the arming holder read back from the
  checkpoint record (resume is holder-bound). One raw connection per invocation against the resolved
  mesh target; the journal's result bound is taken from the broker's own max_payload.

  `docs/workflows.md` gains an "Operating a run" section, the connector docs bundle carries it, and
  every connector folds a workflow steer (`WORKFLOW_STEER`) into its agent instructions beside the
  mesh-first steer, so agents reach for a durable journalled run instead of improvising long
  coordination loops in their own context.

## 0.33.3

## 0.33.2

### Patch Changes

- 8e212a6: Fix two defects that each, independently, left the AG-UI event plane permanently silent.

  The lifecycle hooks were declared with a split `command`/`args` shape the host schema does not
  have, so the host ran `node` with no script and every hook silently never fired — taking presence,
  peer-message surfacing and the emitter's lazy start with it. The manifest now uses the single-string
  command form, with the interpolated plugin root quoted so paths containing a space still work. The
  plugin directory is also passed on both launch shapes; it was missing from the `--prompt` shape,
  which is how hosted agents start.

  Separately, the emitter set itself up before the endpoint had bound. With `--prompt` the first hook
  beats the first bind, the holder failed terminally, and one line of stderr was the only trace for
  the rest of the session. The emitter now awaits a bounded `whenConnected()` before setup, and that
  wait fails past its window rather than resolving as if connected.

### Minor Changes

- 4ef59c3: A spawned seat now receives a constructed environment (PATH/HOME/locale, the machine-wide COTAL\_\* knobs, connector-declared provider keys) instead of the manager's ambient environment. Host-session markers such as CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION no longer leak into seats and silently disable transcript saving. The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

- 569f4d3: An empty message id is never a dedup key, and an id-less delivery is individually addressable at the drain seam.

  Two distinct messages that each carry an empty id collapsed to one: the receiver-side id
  dedup read empty-equals-empty as a duplicate, silently dropped the second, and once the
  first was handled it dropped every later empty-id message on arrival. Measured live, two
  such messages arrived on the wire and only the first was ever delivered.

  An empty id is now treated as no id: the ingest coalescing (pending, handled, protected)
  is skipped for it in both directions, so distinct messages that carry an empty id are all
  delivered. At the drain seam a per-delivery receive key (the wire id when there is one, a
  per-session secret-namespaced minted key when the id is empty, never on any wire) is what
  hosts, adapters, and the exact-key drain select by: cotal_inbox, the Claude Code hooks,
  the OpenCode plugin, the Codex host, the Hermes bridge and its Python sidecar, and the pi
  driver. The drain API is renamed for what it takes (drainInboxDeliveries, missingKeys).
  Eviction classification, in-flight holds, scope routing, the focus-recall tie-break, and
  the scoped drain's selection no longer key on the empty id either. The Hermes bridge no
  longer wedges on an empty-id message. Delivery pumps in core now treat an absent or
  non-string id as a malformed envelope per SPEC section 5 (durable terminate, live drop,
  history and recall skip).

  What this restores: before the receive key, an id-less delivery was unaddressable: the
  raw id swept every pending empty-id item in one drain call, and once filtering closed
  that, the item could never be drained or acked, was re-shown on every windowed inbox
  read, and on a durable channel accumulated as an unretirable entry until the 200-entry
  overflow valve evicted it, roughly a model turn of churn per entry, while one hostile
  empty-id ambient publish self-drove back-to-back host turns on the pi adapter. This was
  a violation of the SPEC section 8 ack-only-after-surfaced obligation at the receiver,
  not only an adapter defect.

  The cost is stated rather than hidden: with no id there is no coalescing either, so a
  redelivered copy of an empty-id message can surface twice on a path that is already
  at-least-once (live remains at-most-once). Dedup for real ids is unchanged: their
  receive key is their wire id and their coalescing is untouched. SPEC section 4, section
  7 item 5, section 8, and section 12 item 12 now state the receiver-scoped rule, and the
  client-builder guidance mirrors it.

  One named follow-up stays open: Plane-3 durable fan-out derives its publish msgID from
  the message id, so distinct empty-id messages can still be collapsed inside the broker's
  duplicate window on a durable channel before this receiver sees them. That path is its
  own issue; this change's guarantee is the receiver.

- a71fbd3: A failed turn is published as a run error, so a reader of an event plane can tell a turn that failed from a turn that finished.

  Every connector used to close a run with `RUN_FINISHED` whichever way the turn ended, including a
  turn its own harness had already classified as failed. `RUN_ERROR` was in the vocabulary, the
  bracket machine accepted it as a close and the dashboard rendered it, but the shared close path had
  no way to say it.

  The close on the shared emitter and holder now takes an optional failure, and two connectors supply
  one from a record they actually receive. Claude Code ends a failed turn on its own `StopFailure`
  hook, and that turn now closes with `RUN_ERROR` carrying the harness's error kind (`rate_limit`,
  `billing_error`, `server_error` and the rest) as the code. OpenCode reports a dead turn on
  `session.error`, and that turn now closes with `RUN_ERROR` carrying OpenCode's own error name and
  reason, except a turn a person stopped, which arrives on the same event and is not a failure.

  The shared close also bounds that failure detail. Upstream free text (`error_details`,
  `data.message`) can encode past the live frame ceiling; packing it as-is used to refuse the close
  before any terminal became durable and then permanently kill the holder. The close now rebuilds the
  one `RUN_ERROR` so it fits, keeps the code, and the emitted message says the original detail was
  omitted or shortened because of the bound. A short message is unchanged. There is no second protocol
  and no per-connector size table: every producer already goes through this close.

  Deliberately not built: connector-specific caps, a second close method, preview-plane truncation on
  the durable path, and any change to `packUnits`'s fail-loud rule for source observations. Those would
  not close this hole and would duplicate a contract that already has a caller.

  Migration: nothing is removed and no existing call changes shape. A consumer that only handles
  `RUN_FINISHED` now sees fewer of them on failing sessions; the event type it needs to also handle
  has been part of the vocabulary and accepted by the bracket machine all along.

### Minor Changes

- a087c2b: A spawned agent now inherits the operator's environment. A harness you installed and configured
  should behave under `cotal spawn` the way it behaves when you run it yourself, and the alternative
  was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors: every new provider needed a change in Cotal
  before it would work through a managed spawn. `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEYS` and the per-connector lists
  that extended it are gone, and Cotal no longer names an inference vendor anywhere in its source.

  Cotal still resets its own `COTAL_*` namespace before the child starts, keeping the machine-wide
  knobs (`COTAL_HOME`, the feedback set, the default-agent pair, the `*_BIN` overrides, the timing
  knobs). That reset is not configurable, because it is identity and not preference: a connector
  supplies the per-session names for each child and does so conditionally, so an inherited value is
  never overwritten and would hand an agent another agent's credential path, ACL, or lifecycle uid.
  The whole prefix is stripped rather than a named list, because which names a connector sets varies
  between connectors and a deny-list only ever names what its author remembered.

  To confine a spawned agent instead, declare `spawn.env` in the cotal config file. The child then
  gets a fixed OS allow-list plus exactly the names you list. An empty array is a real policy meaning
  the OS allow-list alone. Note what this does and does not buy: `HOME` is forwarded either way, so
  an agent with a shell reads `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` regardless, and this protects only secrets that
  live nowhere but the environment.

- 34caaf4: Agent seats no longer export their connection material into the environment every descendant
  process inherits. The broker URL, the creds path, the auth token, the user-mode identity and the
  local control token now ride a private 0600 launch-material file whose path is the only thing in the
  seat's environment; pi, codex and OpenCode drop even that path once they have read it (for OpenCode
  that happens in the `opencode serve` process its seat shim starts, which is also what runs the
  session's tool calls), while claude and hermes keep the reference because their readers are
  short-lived children that start later. A session driven by hand still sets `COTAL_CREDS` / `COTAL_SERVERS` itself, and a
  launch that carries both carriers is refused rather than resolved by precedence.

- 5e3951a: events: an agent's second session publishes again, and the halt names the causes that can actually produce it

  Only an agent's first session ever published AG-UI events. Every session after it halted the emitter
  permanently. The write-ahead log is keyed per session and the event channel is keyed per principal,
  so a new session opened with an expectation that its channel was empty, while its own previous
  session had already filled it. The broker refused the publish and the emitter stopped for good. On a
  mesh with user authentication the agent name is the actor, and a restart forks the session id, so
  the first restart of any agent spawned with the event plane armed was enough to take its event
  stream dark. An agent on a static credential is reached the same way through preserve and resume,
  which relaunches the recorded identity while the session under it is new. Reproduced against a real
  broker across three sessions, and it did not recover on its own.

  Alongside the per-session logs the connector now keeps one record per principal, holding the last
  sequence the broker assigned on that channel, so a new session continues the stream instead of
  starting again from nothing. An installation upgrading from a release without that record recovers
  the sequence from the session logs already on disk, so the fix applies to agents that have already
  run rather than only to ones starting fresh. That recovery reads the sequence a log took an
  acknowledgement for but did not fold, which is where the real number sits when a session died in
  that window, and it refuses a log it cannot account for rather than taking the largest number it can
  find. An abandonment after a channel purge clears the record with the logs, and a record that reads
  zero is never re-seeded, because that is what abandonment writes.

  The halt message previously offered three causes, another writer, a restored stream, or a filtered
  purge, and the real one was not among them, so an operator went looking for a rogue writer. It now
  names what a moved tip can actually mean, including a concurrent session under the same principal
  and a frontier record that disagrees with the stream. It also names the one cause that is not
  another writer at all: a crash between the shared record's advance and the log's own record of the
  ack leaves the record ahead of the expectation the log is still holding, so the retry publishes a
  sequence the subject has already passed and the halt looks exactly like a foreign write. The
  message says what that state looks like on disk. It also states the real gap in the per-principal
  lock rather than claiming the lock prevents the case the halt fires on: the lock file lives under a
  workspace root, so a second emitter started against a different root meets no lock, while another
  host or a stale pid refuse the start instead of slipping past. And where it used to name an
  abandonment as the remedy, it now says no command performs one, names the directory that has to go,
  and says removing less leaves a mixed state the next start refuses. Clearing that state is valid
  only once the channel itself is back to empty, which of the causes above is true of a filtered
  purge alone; on any other cause the tip stays where it is, so removing the directory returns the
  same halt with the logs a tip could have been rebuilt from now gone, and the channel purge is the
  half that comes first.

  The scan that recovers a tip from the session logs refuses a linked entry and refuses a linked log,
  matching the directory chain that creates this state and already refused a symlinked component.
  Without that, a link planted where a session directory belongs took the scan to a log in another
  tree. What it does not close is a session directory swapped for a link in the moment between the
  check and the open: the non-following open flag covers the final name only, and closing that window
  would take a per-component walk the scan does not do. A log reachable under more than one name is
  refused too, and the ordinary way to produce one is copying a workspace with hard links, which makes
  the recovery refuse every log rather than half-trust them.

  The record itself is now graded on the file rather than on the writer's view of it. A second view of
  one record could take the tip backwards with no error at all, because the comparison was against
  memory while the rule was written about the value on disk. Nothing shipped reaches that today, and
  that is measured rather than assumed: a stale view publishes a stale expectation and the broker
  refuses it before an acknowledgement exists to record. It is guarded anyway, because an assumption
  recorded in prose where a guard belongs is what produced this defect in the first place. A record
  that goes corrupt underneath a live writer is now refused before the write instead of being
  overwritten, and an abandonment refuses outright when it cannot reach the shared record, rather than
  clearing the log's half and reporting a completed abandonment.

  MIGRATION: `AguiEmitter.start` now requires a `subjectFrontier`, and refuses at runtime without one
  rather than falling back to the per-session number, because that fallback is the defect. `EventWal`
  refuses the same way: a log with no record bound has no publish expectation and says so instead of
  offering its own last acknowledged sequence, and an abandonment on an unbound log now refuses rather
  than clearing half of the state, so anyone driving a log outside the emitter must bind one first.
  Anyone embedding the emitter directly must open a `FileSubjectFrontier` at the `subjectPath` that
  `ensureEventWalDir` now returns and pass it. Connectors in this repository are updated. No wire
  bytes move and no grant changes: the channel grammar is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 57d3a57: A Claude session publishes a structured event plane, and the `tr-<name>` transcript mirror is
  retired

  A session launched with `cotal spawn --events` now actually publishes. The Claude connector maps
  its session records to structured events behind the same hook relay the mirror used to sit behind:
  run boundaries per turn, assistant text, reasoning, and each tool call with its arguments, its end
  and its result, written to a per-session write-ahead log before they go on the wire so a restart
  resumes at its cursor instead of replaying or skipping. Until now no connector constructed the
  emitter at all, so every event channel was empty.

  The `tr-<name>` mirror is removed in the same change rather than deprecated alongside it. Gone with
  it: the `--transcript` and `--no-transcript` flags on `cotal spawn`, the `transcript` field on the
  manager's spawn op and its service contract, `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT` and `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT`,
  `LaunchOpts.transcript`, `Connector.transcriptChannel`, and the mirror in all three connectors that
  carried one.

  MIGRATION. If you read a `tr-<name>` channel, nothing publishes to it any more. A managed session no
  longer mirrors its prose there under any flag or environment variable, and a spawn that passes
  `--transcript` now fails on an unknown flag rather than being ignored. Read the session's event
  channel instead: launch with `--events` and subscribe to `events.<owner>.<actor>`, which is keyed on
  the session's principal. On a static mesh that is `events.local.<key>`, where the key is what the
  manager allocated and the spawn reply carries it as `id`; on a user-auth mesh it is
  `events.<your-owner>.<agent-name>`, where the actor half is the agent's own name. `connect-claude.md`
  gives both forms. `cotal console` and the web console render event frames directly. Unlike
  `tr-<name>`, you cannot simply subscribe: the plane needs an out-of-band grant, and the command for
  it is under "To let something read a plane" below.

  What you gain and what you lose, both stated. A tool call now arrives with its full arguments, its
  end and its result, in a vocabulary a program can read, where the mirror gave a truncated one-liner
  of glyph-prefixed text. What you lose is prompt text somebody else wrote: the mirror republished
  every prompt, and the event plane withholds the body of a turn the agent did not author, because
  republishing a peer's message onto a channel that peer may not read crosses an ACL boundary. A
  peer-authored turn still opens a run and still shows the work it caused. One stated limit on that,
  because the loss column is only useful if it is complete: a tool result is this session's own output
  and is republished, so peer text quoted inside one still reaches the wire. A cell in
  `agui-authorship.smoke.ts` holds that as a measured limit rather than leaving it to be discovered.

  A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is creating, and no other. A spawn that names
  a different agent's event channel in `allowSubscribe` or `allowPublish` is refused at the door,
  because that channel carries the session's tool inputs and outputs. The same rule runs on a manager
  resume: a retained inventory naming another agent's event channel is refused rather than adopted.

  The rule reads a **concrete** channel, two principal tokens and nothing else. A pattern such as
  `events.<owner>.>` is not an event channel to it and passes untouched, governed by ordinary ACL
  authority. That is deliberate, since the pattern is the form an operator writes on purpose for an
  observer.

  To let something read a plane, grant it out of band. The refusal prints one command, spelled out in
  full, for the mesh it is running on. On a user-auth mesh:
  `cotal actor grant <reader> --owner <owner> --scope '' --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --allow-publish
''`, every field named because `actor grant` is an upsert of the whole row and an omitted flag is the
  wide default (`>` read, `>` post, `spawn,role:default` scope), not "leave it alone". On a static mesh there is no
  actor ledger for `actor grant` to write to, so mint the reader instead:
  `cotal mint watcher --profile agent --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --provision`, the agent profile and
  not the observer one, since `mint` reads `--allow-subscribe` only for that profile and refuses it off
  that profile.

  `cotal mint` now REFUSES `--allow-subscribe` / `--allow-publish` off the agent profile rather than
  ignoring them. Those profiles carry a FIXED read set, the chat plane for observer and the whole
  messaging plane for admin, so
  `--profile observer --allow-subscribe <one channel>` used to exit 0, print a success line, and hand
  out a credential that reads every channel in the space: an operator asking to narrow got the
  opposite, silently. `--role` and `--provision` were already refused there for the same reason. The
  rows in `cli.md` and the sentence in `build-a-client.md` now say the same thing.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 4cf5f72: Give a session's structured event plane a way to be turned on, and a channel that names who is publishing.

  An agent can now be launched with `cotal spawn --events`, foreground or detached, which publishes
  that session's structured event stream, what it did rather than the prose it wrote, on a channel of
  its own so an external observer or UI can read it. Off by default. Nothing about an existing launch
  changes.

  **The channel is named after the principal, never the display name.** It is `events.<owner>.<actor>`,
  derived from the principal the manager actually allocated. A display name is UI convenience: this
  mesh permits two live agents to carry one, and the manager itself auto-numbers a collision, so a
  name-keyed channel would fuse two principals onto one subject and, in auth mode, would authorize both
  onto it from a value that identifies neither. The derivation is a single function on the connector
  contract, `eventChannel`, so the subject the manager grants and the subject the session publishes to
  cannot drift apart. A connector that does not implement it refuses `--events` before any provisioning
  rather than starting a session whose events have nowhere legal to land, and the refusal releases the
  name it had already reserved.

  **The flag and the grant are deliberately separate.** Holding publish rights on a channel is not a
  request to publish to it. An agent file or a manifest can hand-write anything into `allowPublish`, so
  if a grant could arm the plane, any author who could write an agent file could turn on a full
  transcript of another seat's tool inputs and outputs without ever touching the launch grammar. Only
  the launch arms the session; the grant is what makes the arming useful. `cotal_spawn`, the peer-facing
  tool, does not expose the option at all. That is the shape of the tool and not a control-plane refusal:
  the manager's spawn service op is a second door onto the same handler and still accepts the field,
  which is a pre-existing property of that door and is fenced separately.

  **The flag rides the whole launch path, including the record a restart reads.** It is on the
  foreground launch, the detached spawn payload, the manager service contract, and the resume document,
  so a manager restart brings an armed session back armed. The foreground path mints its own grant, from
  the principal it allocated, and passes the workspace root the emitter's write-ahead log needs: a
  session armed by one launch surface and not the other would be a flag that means two different
  things. A resume adopts the credential the spawn wrote rather than minting a new
  one, so what a restart can lose is the record: either the channel leaves `allowPublish`, or the
  arming flag does and the session returns holding publish rights it will never use, which reads as a
  working system with an empty panel. Both halves are now carried and both are asserted.

  **One behaviour change to state plainly.** The foreground launch now passes the mesh's root as the
  launch's workspace root, on every foreground spawn rather than only on an armed one, which is what the
  manager has always done. Two connectors already read that field and root their per-agent home at it:
  Codex, which puts its per-agent home under it, and OpenCode, which puts its database and its serve
  pidfile there. Both previously fell back to the directory the operator happened to run the command
  in. So a foreground Codex or OpenCode session moves its local state from that directory to the mesh
  root, which is where its detached counterpart has always put it. Operators who ran `cotal spawn` from
  somewhere other than the mesh root will find that session's state under the mesh root instead. The
  Claude connector reads the field only on an armed launch, and Hermes and pi do not read it at all.

  **Supporting pieces in the shared connector runtime.** The event vocabulary is exported from
  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` for the first time, so a connector can reach it by package name instead of
  by deep path. The emitter gained a way to close an open run out of band: a harness reports the end of
  a turn through a lifecycle hook that writes no record, so a record-sourced stream previously had no
  vehicle for a turn terminal. The closing frame is an ordinary frame with one exception, it republishes
  the source cursor unchanged, because advancing it would mark records consumed that were never mapped
  and leave a consumer no gap to notice it by. The emitter refuses to close while a message or a tool
  call is still open under the run, while a frame is still pending recovery, and after a halt.

  **One pre-existing limit this makes visible earlier.** In user mode the allocated actor is the display
  name, and principal tokens forbid `-`, which is reserved as the principal name form's separator. The
  manager's collision handling appends `-2`, so the second user-mode launch of any persona has never
  been principal-keyable; it already failed at the identity and provisioning sites. The event grant is
  derived before provisioning, so that launch now fails before it leaves a footprint rather than after.
  The underlying naming limit is unchanged and is not addressed here.

### Patch Changes

- 219d33c: `cotal spawn --agent pi --prompt <text>` now delivers the prompt as Pi's initial message (its first turn) instead of silently dropping it; an empty prompt, or one starting with `-` or `@`, refuses the launch. The connector contract no longer describes an initial prompt as something a connector may ignore: a connector delivers it or throws at launch. The other connectors follow the same rule: Claude Code and Codex refuse a prompt that is empty after trimming instead of dropping it, and Hermes refuses an initial prompt outright until its first turn is wired.

### Patch Changes

- a306df0: Never consume a Claude Code peer's message without delivering it.

  An unattended agent could go permanently silent after a direct message. The connector's lifecycle
  hook acked the message and marked it handled while it was still only _formatting_ the hook reply
  that carries it, but that reply has to reach the runtime through the hook relay, which abandons the
  exchange after two seconds. When it did not land, the agent's model never saw the message while the
  connector had already committed it — and because the message was recorded as handled, its own
  JetStream redelivery was acked and discarded on arrival, so nothing could bring it back. The peer
  simply stopped answering, and only a human noticed.

  A message is now committed only once the reply carrying it has cleared both legs of its journey, not
  just the first. The hook relay confirms back to the connector only after its own write to the
  runtime has completed cleanly, and the connector waits for that receipt
  (`startControlServer` gains an additive `onReply(event, delivered)`, and a client opts in with
  `handoff: true`); anything less leaves the message un-acked, so it redelivers and the agent is woken
  again. Binding to the connector's own socket write was not enough: a large injection that the
  relay's one-second flush backstop kills mid-write reaches nothing, and the batch was still
  committed. The verdict is tracked per hook event rather than in one slot, because hook frames are
  separate connections that can overlap and would otherwise let one frame's outcome commit another
  frame's messages. This errs toward delivering twice rather than losing one: a re-surfaced batch is
  flagged as a possible repeat.

  Two further ways the same path could go quiet are closed. Presence updates no longer gate delivery —
  a failed presence write used to skip both the message injection and the end-of-turn flush of
  anything held while the agent was busy. And a rejected wake notification is now retried with a
  bounded backoff, since for an idle agent it is the only thing that can wake it.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- f89560a: New Codex connector (`--agent codex`): an OpenAI Codex session as a full lateral mesh peer, in Codex's own TUI. A host-mode peer drives a `codex app-server` thread over JSON-RPC: inbound batches wake a real turn, and directed messages steer INTO a live turn mid-flight.

  `cotal spawn --agent codex` opens Codex's own TUI. The app-server runs as a loopback websocket listener guarded by a per-incarnation capability token (0600, inside the agent's private home), and the TUI attaches to the very thread the mesh drives, so mesh turns render as they happen and anything you type is a real user turn on that same thread. With no terminal (piped output, CI, a smoke) the host stays headless with an activity feed instead; `COTAL_CODEX_TUI=1|0` picks the mode explicitly when the tty check would guess wrong. Once Codex owns the terminal the host's own log moves to `host.log` in the agent's private home, and the handoff line names that path so a later failure is findable.

  The shared `cotal_*` tools are served by the host process itself over a bearer-authenticated loopback MCP endpoint, with the token passed to codex by env var name so it never reaches the process table. Because the app-server is the MCP client, the same tools work on a mesh-driven turn and on one typed into the TUI; the connector's own tools are pre-approved so an unattended agent never stalls on an approval prompt nobody is watching, and `mcp_servers.cotal.*` is reserved and refused rather than silently overridden.

  Autonomy defaults suit an agent woken by peer messages when nobody is watching: `approval_policy=never` (never ask before running a command, not refuse), `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, and `sandbox_workspace_write={network_access=true}`. Network is on because Codex's own workspace-write default has it off, which breaks installing a dependency or pushing a branch with an error that reads like the task is impossible rather than the sandbox refusing; filesystem containment is kept, because a peer's message is a remote input that can make the agent run commands. The network default is applied only where the sandbox is actually `workspace-write`, so tightening the mode does not leave a network grant in the launch. All three are overridable per spawn with `--opt` (including `sandbox_mode=danger-full-access` for no sandbox at all), while an interactive `approval_policy` is refused loud rather than auto-answered on the operator's behalf.

  The guide states the sandbox's guarantee literally: it blocks out-of-workspace local filesystem writes, and does not block reads, exfiltration, or networked side effects. With the network on, a peer-driven turn can read broadly and send what it reads, reach loopback and link-local services, and act through any credential it can read, including irreversibly, via a force-push or an API delete. Containing filesystem writes is not the same as containing damage, and the docs say so rather than implying the residual is disclosure-only. The offline, tighter-mode, and separate-OS-user mitigations are named in both the autonomy section and Limits.

  At-least-once delivery with exact-id acks on turn completion: a failed turn retries with backoff, an interrupt redelivers, and an app-server crash restarts the child in place on the same mesh lifecycle and re-drives the un-acked batch (a crash loop is fatal, never an endless respawn). Presence from the event stream, an opt-in transcript mirror, model catalog + reasoning-effort variants (`cotal models --agent codex`, `--variant`), `--opt` passthrough to codex `-c` config overrides, and a private per-agent `CODEX_HOME` (operator config/hooks/MCP servers never load; auth.json symlinked; trust writes never touch the operator's config). Unwired options fail loud: `--resume` (a resumed codex thread comes up without its configured MCP servers, so the agent would be mute on the mesh) and tool-sharing.

  Also fixes the seed reconciler, which treated a generation match alone as up-to-date: a built-in connector added at an unchanged generation would never seed on an already-installed workstation (`--agent codex` reporting no connector installed). Both fast paths now also require every `SEED_BUILTINS` entry to be present in the ever-seeded set.

  A connector can now declare `launchHint`, the one line a foreground `cotal spawn` prints about what to expect next. That text used to be hard-coded to Claude Code's first-run gate for every agent type, telling operators of other harnesses to press Enter at a prompt that never appears.

  The web dashboard gains Codex branding (the OpenAI mark, from Simple Icons), so a codex agent renders with an icon and a label instead of a blank badge. That map was hand-maintained with nothing tying it to the connector set, so it is now covered by a test: every official connector must have a complete entry, and a new connector cannot ship icon-less with a green suite again.

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

## 0.12.0

### Patch Changes

- 046f485: Re-announce an unacked durable message on JetStream redelivery, so a wake the host dropped (e.g. during Claude's channel startup window) recovers at the next redelivery instead of leaving the agent a zombie until an unrelated message arrives.

## 0.11.4

### Patch Changes

- 1935221: Ship the built-in agent connectors (claude, opencode, hermes, pi) as removable `cotal ext` plugins. They are seeded on first run through the same `ext add` path a third party uses, resolved lazily per spawn, and deletable with `cotal ext remove`; they are no longer hardcoded imports or dependencies of `cotal-ai`.

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

### Patch Changes

### Minor Changes

- 6c40280: Release the 0.10 line with the onboarding and local-stack work since 0.9.1:

  - Rework the CLI around dispatcher-parsed commands, operator-installed extensions (`cotal ext`), and extension-packaged web/demo surfaces.
  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- a10ed79: OpenCode connector: mirror each agent's session transcript to its per-agent `tr-<name>` channel, event-driven from the plugin's in-process bus events (`message.updated` / `message.part.updated` / `session.idle`) — parity with the Claude connector, with no per-turn session refetch. The `tr-<name>` channel convention is exposed through the `Connector` contract (`Connector.transcriptChannel`) so the manager can grant the agent's publish ACL without the channel literal living in `@cotal-ai/core`, and the manager forwards control-plane `capabilities` (`COTAL_CAPABILITIES`) so a manifest-spawned agent exposes the `cotal_spawn` / `cotal_persona` tools its creds already authorize. Adds an end-to-end smoke for the mirror (`smoke:opencode-transcript`).

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

### Patch Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

### Minor Changes

- 0954ea6: Transcript mirror: a managed Claude Code session now publishes its own condensed
  transcript (assistant text, tool one-liners, truncated results) to a per-agent
  `tr-<name>` channel, driven by the lifecycle hooks' `transcript_path`. Gated by
  `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT`, which `buildLaunch` sets for managed sessions; personal
  sessions never mirror.

### Patch Changes

- 73b030f: Add the `cotal_feedback` sender: a connector tool (always exposed) and a `cotal feedback "<summary>"` CLI mode. With a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` feedback routes to the keyed broker intake as before; without one it goes to the public intake at `https://cotal.ai/v1/feedback`, which requires a contact email (`COTAL_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` → git config → ask). `COTAL_FEEDBACK_URL` overrides either URL for self-hosted intakes.
