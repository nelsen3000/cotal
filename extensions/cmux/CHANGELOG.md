### Patch Changes

- 5f13124: Private launch files now have an owner. The Claude persona file, the Claude shared-server MCP config file and the pi persona file are listed on the new `LaunchSpec.artifacts`, and the launcher removes them once it has proved the agent process gone. On the default pty runtime the manager removes them when it sees the agent exit; on tmux, cmux, orca and herdr the manager removes them by polling the seat's status and waiting for the runtime's exit proof; the foreground `cotal spawn` removes them when its child exits. Every one of those launches also starts its child through the new core `reclaimWithChild`: a watcher started beside the child removes the files once the child's process is gone, and tries a failed removal again every five seconds until it succeeds, so a killed manager or foreground `cotal spawn` no longer strands them (POSIX; Windows has no shell for the watcher). Each directory name carries a random per-launch identity, so a stale path can never name a later launch's directory. The tmux, cmux, orca and herdr runtimes now throw the new core `SpawnRefused` for an unsafe name, an unreachable backend, (herdr) a missing working directory or an unknown layout, (orca) a working directory that is missing or outside any Orca worktree, and a launcher script they cannot write or (tmux, herdr) a session or server that will not start, all before the agent's command is handed to the backend, and the manager removes the files at once. A removal that fails, after an exit or after a refusal, is tried again until it succeeds. A batch resume removes the files of specs it built and never launched. Both connectors now refuse a bad model, prompt or launch option before writing anything. Any other spawn that throws is not proof that nothing started, so its files stay for the child's watcher, or for the OS temp reaper when no child started, as do a killed launcher's on Windows. A seat started under a custodian with `launchSeat` from `@cotal-ai/seat`, which the manager no longer does for a new launch, hands them to that custodian: a launch it refuses before any process started removes them at once, the custodian removes them when it sees the agent exit, a removal that fails stays on the custody record, and a reap that proves the seat gone removes what the record still lists from the temp dir the launch wrote to, so a successor with a different `TMPDIR` still removes them. Losing a custodian's connection no longer counts as the agent's exit. The docs now say that owner-private means any process running as the same user can read the file while it exists.

### Patch Changes

- 9927b86: Pin the cmux wait-stub to a .cjs extension so its module system stops depending on TMPDIR

  The cmux package suite writes a small stub CLI under `tmpdir()` and points
  `CMUX_BUNDLED_CLI_PATH` at it. The stub body is CommonJS and calls `require("node:fs")`,
  but the file was written with no extension, and node decides the module system for an
  extensionless file from the nearest `package.json` above it. With TMPDIR outside the
  repository the stub loaded as CommonJS and the suite passed 12 of 12. With TMPDIR
  pointing inside a `"type": "module"` package the same stub loaded as ESM, `require`
  threw `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`, and the suite died
  after 5 assertions. `smoke:package-test-contract` reported the same failure through its
  `@cotal-ai/cmux: filtered test command exits 0` cell.

  Naming the stub `cmux-stub.cjs` fixes the module system at the file, so the result no
  longer depends on where the ambient TMPDIR points. Nothing reads the stub by basename,
  and the path reaches the runtime only through `CMUX_BUNDLED_CLI_PATH`, which places no
  constraint on the extension.

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.

### Minor Changes

- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.

  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

### Minor Changes

- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).
